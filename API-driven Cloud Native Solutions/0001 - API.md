An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be structured, enabling developers to integrate services without needing to understand the internal workings of the system.  

### Types of APIs:
1. **REST API** – Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and works with JSON or XML.
2. **SOAP API** – Uses XML-based messaging and operates over HTTP or other protocols.
3. **GraphQL API** – Allows clients to request specific data structures, reducing over-fetching.
4. **WebSocket API** – Enables real-time, bidirectional communication.

### Common Use Cases:
- Fetching weather data from an external service.
- Authenticating users via OAuth (e.g., Google Login).
- Accessing payment gateways (e.g., PayPal API).
- Integrating machine learning models (e.g., OpenAI API).
