### **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**  

The **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** is an open-source foundation that promotes **cloud-native technologies** to help organizations build and run scalable, resilient applications in modern cloud environments.

---

## **1. What is CNCF?**  
- Founded in **2015** by the **Linux Foundation**.  
- Supports **open-source projects** that enable cloud-native development.  
- Focuses on **containerization, microservices, and orchestration**.  
- Manages projects like **Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and Helm**.  

---

## **2. Key Goals of CNCF**  
✅ **Promote Cloud-Native Adoption** – Help businesses transition to cloud-native architectures.  
✅ **Standardization** – Provide a **vendor-neutral** cloud-native ecosystem.  
✅ **Open-Source Collaboration** – Support **community-driven** cloud-native projects.  
✅ **Scalability & Resilience** – Enable **high-performance** cloud applications.  

---

## **3. Core Cloud-Native Principles**  
CNCF defines cloud-native apps based on:  

1️⃣ **Containerization** – Use of **Docker, Podman**, or other container runtimes.  
2️⃣ **Orchestration** – Managing workloads using **Kubernetes**.  
3️⃣ **Microservices** – Breaking applications into smaller, independent services.  
4️⃣ **Service Mesh** – Managing communication between microservices using **Envoy, Istio, Linkerd**.  
5️⃣ **Observability** – Monitoring apps with **Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd**.  
6️⃣ **Serverless** – Running event-driven functions with **Knative** or **OpenFaaS**.
