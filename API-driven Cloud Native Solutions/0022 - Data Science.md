## **2. Data Science Process (Lifecycle)**  

### **Step 1: Problem Definition**  
- Identify the **business problem** or research question.  
- Example: Predict customer churn for a telecom company.

### **Step 2: Data Collection**  
- Collect data from sources like **databases, APIs, sensors, or web scraping**.  
- Example: Customer demographics, call history, and payment data.

### **Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- Handle **missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies**.  
- Convert data into a structured format.

### **Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Identify **patterns, trends, and correlations**.  
- Use statistical summaries and visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, etc.).

### **Step 5: Feature Engineering & Selection**  
- Create new features or remove redundant ones to improve model performance.

### **Step 6: Model Building**  
- Choose an appropriate **machine learning algorithm** (e.g., regression, decision trees, neural networks).  
- Train and evaluate models using data.

### **Step 7: Model Evaluation & Optimization**  
- Use **metrics like accuracy, precision-recall, RMSE, F1-score** to assess models.  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.

### **Step 8: Deployment & Monitoring**  
- Deploy models into production (e.g., API, cloud, edge devices).  
- Monitor for **performance degradation** and retrain if needed.
