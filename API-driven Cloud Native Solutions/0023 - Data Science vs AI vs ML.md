## **3. What is Machine Learning (ML)?**  
**Definition:**  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to **learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed**.

**Types of Machine Learning:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Supervised Learning** ‚Äì Model learns from labeled data (e.g., spam detection, house price prediction).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Unsupervised Learning** ‚Äì Model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Reinforcement Learning** ‚Äì Model learns through rewards and penalties (e.g., game AI, self-driving cars).  

**Example:**  
- Netflix recommending movies based on your watch history.  
- Credit card fraud detection using transaction data.
