### **Data Science Processes and Methodologies**  

Data Science follows a structured process to extract insights, build models, and make data-driven decisions. The most common methodologies used in Data Science are **CRISP-DM, OSEMN, and TDSP**.

## **1. General Data Science Process**  

🔹 **Step 1: Problem Definition**  
- Identify the business problem.  
- Define objectives and expected outcomes.  
- Example: Predict customer churn for a telecom company.  

🔹 **Step 2: Data Collection**  
- Gather relevant data from databases, APIs, web scraping, etc.  
- Types: Structured (tables) & Unstructured (text, images).  
- Example: Customer transaction history, call logs.  

🔹 **Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- Normalize, encode categorical variables, and engineer features.  
- Example: Convert dates into numerical values for analysis.  

🔹 **Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Understand data distribution using **statistics & visualization**.  
- Find correlations, trends, and patterns.  
- Example: Analyzing customer age distribution vs. churn rate.  

🔹 **Step 5: Model Selection & Training**  
- Choose an appropriate **Machine Learning (ML) model**.  
- Split data into **training & testing** sets.  
- Train model using algorithms (e.g., **Random Forest, Neural Networks**).  

🔹 **Step 6: Model Evaluation**  
- Measure accuracy using metrics like **RMSE, F1-score, ROC-AUC**.  
- Tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.  

🔹 **Step 7: Deployment & Monitoring**  
- Deploy the model into a production system (using Flask, FastAPI, etc.).  
- Monitor model drift and retrain as needed.
