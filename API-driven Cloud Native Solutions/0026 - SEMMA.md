### **SEMMA: Data Mining Process**  

SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) is a **data mining methodology** developed by SAS (Statistical Analysis System). It provides a structured approach to processing and analyzing large datasets to extract useful insights.  

---

## **📌 5 Stages of SEMMA**  

### **1️⃣ Sample (Data Sampling)**
🔹 Extract a **representative subset** of the data.  
🔹 Ensure the sample is **large enough** to capture meaningful patterns.  
🔹 Tools: SQL, Pandas, Apache Spark.  

🔹 **Example:** A bank selects **10,000 customer records** from a dataset of **1 million** to detect fraud.  

---

### **2️⃣ Explore (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA)**
🔹 Understand **data distribution, trends, and patterns**.  
🔹 Detect missing values, outliers, and correlations.  
🔹 Use **statistical summaries, visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)**.  

🔹 **Example:** Analyzing sales trends for a retail store across different seasons.  

---

### **3️⃣ Modify (Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering)**
🔹 **Handle missing values, remove outliers, normalize data**.  
🔹 Create new features (feature engineering) to improve model performance.  
🔹 Transform categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding).  

🔹 **Example:** Converting raw text customer reviews into **sentiment scores** for analysis.  

---

### **4️⃣ Model (Machine Learning & AI Modeling)**
🔹 Apply **statistical models, machine learning algorithms** (Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks).  
🔹 Tune **hyperparameters** for optimization.  
🔹 Use **cross-validation** to improve accuracy.  

🔹 **Example:** Predicting customer churn using a **Random Forest model**.  

---

### **5️⃣ Assess (Model Evaluation & Validation)**
🔹 Evaluate model performance using metrics:  
   - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score** (classification)  
   - **RMSE, R²** (regression)  
🔹 Perform **A/B testing** before deployment.  
🔹 Compare models to select the best one.  

🔹 **Example:** A company compares a **Logistic Regression model vs. XGBoost** to predict credit card fraud.
