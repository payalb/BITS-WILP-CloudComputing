### **📌 Prefect – Data Orchestration Tool Overview**  

**Prefect** is an **open-source** data workflow orchestration tool designed to simplify the process of building, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines. It combines the best practices of **data engineering** and **DevOps** to improve data workflows' reliability, scalability, and automation. Prefect supports **batch** and **streaming** data workflows and provides excellent **monitoring, logging**, and **error handling** capabilities.

## **🚀 Key Features of Prefect**

### **1️⃣ Dynamic Workflow Scheduling**
🔹 Prefect allows you to create workflows with **dynamic scheduling**, enabling flexible task execution based on the data's arrival or dependencies.  
🔹 **Automatic retries**, **pause/resume execution**, and **task cancellation** provide further control over workflows.  

---

### **2️⃣ Task-Oriented Programming Model**
🔹 **Tasks** are the building blocks of Prefect workflows, representing individual units of work (e.g., ETL jobs, data transformations).  
🔹 Prefect tasks can be easily **reused** and **composed** into larger workflows.  
🔹 Tasks can have **input/output dependencies**, and Prefect takes care of their execution order.

---

### **3️⃣ Prefect Cloud vs. Prefect Server**
- **Prefect Cloud:** A managed service with a **centralized dashboard** for workflow monitoring, scheduling, and management.
- **Prefect Server:** An open-source version of Prefect, suitable for teams who want to self-host and manage workflows.

---

### **4️⃣ Handling Failures & Retry Logic**
🔹 Prefect includes built-in tools for handling task **failures** and automatic **retries** to ensure workflows continue to run without interruption.  
🔹 Users can define **custom retry policies**, such as retrying tasks a specific number of times or after a defined delay.  

---

### **5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability**
🔹 Prefect provides a rich **dashboard** to monitor task execution, track failures, and view logs.  
🔹 Prefect integrates with **third-party tools** like **Prometheus** and **Datadog** for more advanced monitoring.  
🔹 You can easily track the **status**, **logs**, and **metrics** of each task execution in real-time.

---

### **6️⃣ Data Lineage & Metadata Tracking**
🔹 Prefect allows users to track **data lineage** through the workflow's task execution.  
🔹 Each task execution is **logged**, and metadata can be captured for **audit** and **debugging** purposes.  

---

## **📌 Prefect Architecture Overview**

### **1️⃣ Prefect Client**
🔹 The **client** is the user interface that lets you define, deploy, and manage workflows.  
🔹 It communicates with Prefect’s **server** or **cloud** to handle task scheduling and monitoring.

### **2️⃣ Prefect Server/Cloud**
🔹 The **server** or **cloud** handles task scheduling, orchestration, and workflow monitoring.  
🔹 Prefect **server** can be self-hosted, while **Prefect Cloud** is a fully-managed solution.  

### **3️⃣ Prefect Agents**
🔹 **Agents** run the tasks on specific environments, whether on-premises or in the cloud.  
🔹 These agents check in with the server to receive tasks and execute them.  

### **4️⃣ Tasks and Flows**
🔹 **Flows** are groups of interconnected tasks that execute in a specific order.  
🔹 **Tasks** are the individual actions that make up a flow, such as data transformations, API calls, or file transfers.

## **📌 Example: Using Prefect for ETL Workflow**

Let's take an example of creating a simple ETL workflow to extract data, transform it, and load it into a data warehouse:

```python
from prefect import task, Flow
from prefect.executors import LocalExecutor

# Define tasks
@task
def extract_data():
    data = "raw data"
    return data

@task
def transform_data(raw_data):
    transformed_data = raw_data.upper()
    return transformed_data

@task
def load_data(transformed_data):
    print(f"Loading data: {transformed_data}")
    return True

# Define the flow
with Flow("ETL Workflow") as flow:
    raw_data = extract_data()
    transformed_data = transform_data(raw_data)
    load_data(transformed_data)

# Execute the flow with a LocalExecutor
flow.run(executor=LocalExecutor())
```

### **Steps:**
1. **Extract data**: The `extract_data` task simulates extracting raw data.
2. **Transform data**: The `transform_data` task transforms the data (in this case, converting it to uppercase).
3. **Load data**: The `load_data` task simulates loading the transformed data into a data warehouse.
