### **Pre-Trained vs. Fine-Tuned Models**  

| Feature        | **Pre-Trained Model** | **Fine-Tuned Model** |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Definition** | A model trained on a large, general dataset to learn basic patterns. | A pre-trained model further trained on a specific dataset to adapt to a particular task. |
| **Training Data** | Uses a broad dataset (e.g., ImageNet for images, GPT on diverse text). | Uses domain-specific data (e.g., medical records, customer reviews). |
| **Usage** | Directly used for general-purpose tasks (e.g., feature extraction, embeddings). | Customized for a specific application (e.g., sentiment analysis in finance, medical diagnosis). |
| **Training Effort** | Requires massive datasets and high computational resources. | Requires less data and compute power since it builds on existing knowledge. |
| **Examples** | BERT (language), ResNet (vision), GPT-4 (text). | BERT fine-tuned for legal document analysis, GPT-4 fine-tuned for customer support chatbots. |
| **Best For** | Generic tasks where specialized accuracy is not critical. | Domain-specific applications needing high precision. |

Fine-tuning **enhances model performance** in specialized fields while reducing training cost and time.
