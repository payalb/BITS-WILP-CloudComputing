### **Computer Vision**

**Computer Vision** is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to interpret, understand, and make decisions based on visual data, such as images and videos. It is inspired by the human visual system and aims to replicate or even enhance the way humans see, analyze, and understand the visual world. By using algorithms and machine learning models, computer vision can automate tasks that traditionally required human sight, such as object detection, facial recognition, and image classification.

### **Core Tasks in Computer Vision**

1. **Image Classification**  
   **Task**: Classifying an image into one of several predefined categories.  
   **Example**: Identifying whether an image contains a cat, dog, or car.  
   **Approach**: Models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are often used for image classification tasks.

2. **Object Detection**  
   **Task**: Detecting and localizing objects within an image. Unlike image classification, object detection identifies where objects are in the image (bounding boxes).  
   **Example**: Detecting and marking objects such as cars, pedestrians, or traffic signs in a driving video.  
   **Approach**: Algorithms like **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** or **Faster R-CNN** are used for object detection.

3. **Semantic Segmentation**  
   **Task**: Assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. This helps in understanding the context of the image on a pixel level.  
   **Example**: Identifying roads, trees, and buildings in an aerial image.  
   **Approach**: **Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)** are typically used for segmentation tasks.

4. **Instance Segmentation**  
   **Task**: Similar to semantic segmentation, but additionally distinguishing between different instances of the same object class.  
   **Example**: Detecting multiple people in an image and segmenting each person separately.  
   **Approach**: Models like **Mask R-CNN** combine object detection and semantic segmentation for instance segmentation.

5. **Facial Recognition**  
   **Task**: Identifying or verifying individuals based on facial features.  
   **Example**: Unlocking a smartphone using facial recognition or identifying individuals in a crowd.  
   **Approach**: **DeepFace**, **FaceNet**, and **OpenCV** are used for facial recognition tasks.

6. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**  
   **Task**: Converting images of text (printed or handwritten) into machine-encoded text.  
   **Example**: Scanning a document and converting it into editable text.  
   **Approach**: **Tesseract OCR** and **Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs)** are popular for OCR tasks.

7. **Action Recognition**  
   **Task**: Recognizing actions or activities in a video sequence.  
   **Example**: Identifying whether a person is running, jumping, or dancing in a video.  
   **Approach**: **3D CNNs** or **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** combined with CNNs are used for action recognition.

8. **Pose Estimation**  
   **Task**: Detecting the key points of the human body to understand the pose or movements.  
   **Example**: Determining the posture of an athlete during a workout.  
   **Approach**: **OpenPose** is a popular model used for human pose estimation.

9. **Depth Estimation**  
   **Task**: Determining the distance of objects from the camera. This helps in creating 3D maps of environments.  
   **Example**: Enabling autonomous vehicles to estimate the distance of nearby objects using stereo vision.  
   **Approach**: **Stereo Vision** or **Monocular Depth Estimation** with deep learning models like **U-Net** or **DenseNet**.

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
   **Description**: CNNs are the backbone of many computer vision tasks. They use layers of convolutional filters to automatically detect features in images, such as edges, textures, and patterns.  
   **Applications**: Image classification, object detection, facial recognition, etc.

2. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**  
   **Description**: A real-time object detection model that divides an image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for those regions.  
   **Applications**: Real-time object detection in surveillance, autonomous vehicles, etc.

3. **ResNet (Residual Networks)**  
   **Description**: A deep CNN architecture that solves the vanishing gradient problem by using skip connections, allowing for very deep networks.  
   **Applications**: Image classification, feature extraction, etc.

4. **Mask R-CNN**  
   **Description**: An extension of Faster R-CNN that not only detects objects but also generates pixel-wise masks for each object, enabling instance segmentation.  
   **Applications**: Autonomous driving, medical image segmentation, etc.

5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
   **Description**: GANs are used for generating realistic images by training two neural networks (generator and discriminator) in opposition.  
   **Applications**: Image synthesis, data augmentation, and style transfer.
