## **Small Language Models (SLMs)**

### **What Are SLMs?**

Small Language Models (SLMs) are AI models that process and generate human language like LLMs but with **fewer parameters**—typically ranging from **thousands to a few million**. They are designed to perform language-related tasks but with **reduced computational and memory requirements**.

Unlike LLMs (which operate on billions or trillions of parameters and demand powerful GPUs or clusters), SLMs are lightweight and can often run on **edge devices, local servers, or even laptops**.

## **SLM Advantages**

* ✅ **Low Resource Usage**
  Requires less memory, computing power, and storage. Ideal for on-device or offline use.

* ✅ **Faster Inference**
  Quicker response times due to smaller model size and simpler architecture.

* ✅ **Lower Cost**
  Cheaper to train and deploy; no need for expensive GPU clusters or cloud infrastructure.

* ✅ **Better Privacy & Security**
  Can be run locally without sending data to external servers—important for privacy-sensitive applications.

* ✅ **Customizability**
  Easier to fine-tune or modify for niche tasks and domains.

## **SLM Hyperparameters**

Just like LLMs, SLMs use **hyperparameters** to control the behavior of generation. Key ones include:

| Hyperparameter    | Description                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`stream`**      | Whether to return output word-by-word (streaming)                                                                    |
| **`temperature`** | Controls randomness in output (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)                                                      |
| **`max_tokens`**  | Maximum number of tokens to generate                                                                                 |
| **`top_p`**       | Controls diversity by sampling from top-p cumulative probability (e.g., 0.9 means choose from top 90% likely tokens) |

These allow developers to fine-tune **how creative, safe, or concise** the model’s response should be.
