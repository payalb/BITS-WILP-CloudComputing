## **1. Chat API / Completion API**

These APIs allow developers to interact with language models like **GPT-3.5**, **GPT-4**, or other models for generating or completing text.

* **Chat API**: Structured for multi-turn conversations with role-based prompts (`user`, `assistant`, `system`).

  * Example: Building chatbots, coding assistants, teaching apps.
* **Completion API**: Works like a simple prompt-to-text system, suitable for single-turn responses.

  * Example: Autocomplete in editors, idea generators.

---

## **2. Embedding API**

This API turns text into **high-dimensional vectors** that capture semantic meaning.

* **Use Cases**: Semantic search, recommendation systems, document clustering, similarity detection.
* Example: Comparing the similarity between a question and documents to retrieve the most relevant ones.

---

## **3. DALLÂ·E API**

Used to **generate or edit images** from natural language prompts.

* **Capabilities**:

  * Text-to-image generation.
  * Inpainting (edit part of an image using a prompt).
* Example: Creating illustrations, designing game assets, product mockups.

---

## **4. Whisper API**

Whisper is a **speech-to-text** API that transcribes and translates audio.

* **Supports**: Multilingual speech recognition.
* **Use Cases**: Voice notes to text, video captioning, meeting transcription.

## **5. Fine-tuning API (Detailed Explanation)**

### What is Fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of **customizing a base GPT model (like `davinci-002` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`)** on your own dataset to improve performance for your specific task.

Instead of writing long prompts or using complex instructions, you train the model on **examples** of the behavior you want.

---

### How Fine-tuning Works

1. **Prepare Dataset**: A JSONL (JSON Lines) file with examples in this format:

```json
{"messages":[
  {"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant"},
  {"role":"user","content":"How do I bake a cake?"},
  {"role":"assistant","content":"Here's a simple cake recipe..."}
]}
```

2. **Upload File**:
   Use the OpenAI CLI or API to upload your dataset.

```bash
openai file upload --file your_data.jsonl --purpose fine-tune
```

3. **Start Fine-tuning**:
   Create the fine-tuned model from the uploaded file.

```bash
openai fine_tunes.create -t <file-ID> -m gpt-3.5-turbo
```

4. **Use the Model**:
   Once trained, call the fine-tuned model in your app just like GPT-3.5, but with improved performance for your task.

```python
openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:your-org:custom-model-name",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Custom question"}]
)
```

### Fine-tuning Use Cases

| Use Case                    | Example                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Customer Support**        | Tailor responses to your company's tone & FAQs   |
| **Coding Assistance**       | Adapt model to a specific codebase or framework  |
| **Legal or Medical Advice** | Train on domain-specific terminology & responses |
| **Education/Tutors**        | Fine-tune to grade essays, generate quizzes      |
| **Gaming NPCs or Chatbots** | Train on unique character dialogues or scripts   |

### Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG

| Approach                                 | Description                                   | Best For                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Fine-tuning**                          | Teach the model new behavior through examples | Repeated, consistent behavior     |
| **Prompt Engineering**                   | Customizing model behavior via smart prompts  | Quick changes, prototyping        |
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | Combines external data sources with LLMs      | Up-to-date, long, factual content |
