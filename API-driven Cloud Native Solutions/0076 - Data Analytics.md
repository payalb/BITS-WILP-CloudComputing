Here’s a detailed explanation of the **four types of data analytics** with definitions, goals, techniques used, and examples for each:

---

## 1. **Descriptive Analytics**

**Definition**:
Descriptive analytics answers the question: **“What happened?”**
It focuses on summarizing historical data to identify patterns and trends.

**Goal**:
Understand past behavior and performance.

**Techniques Used**:

* Data aggregation
* Data visualization (charts, graphs, dashboards)
* Summary statistics (mean, median, totals)
* Reporting tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)

**Example**:
A retail chain analyzes last year’s sales data and finds:

* Total revenue was \$5 million
* Sales peaked in December
* Product A was the top seller

This helps management understand business performance over time.

## 2. **Diagnostic Analytics**

**Definition**:
Diagnostic analytics answers: **“Why did it happen?”**
It drills down into data to uncover **causes and relationships**.

**Goal**:
Identify reasons for past outcomes.

**Techniques Used**:

* Root cause analysis
* Correlation analysis
* Data mining
* Drill-down, slice-and-dice operations

**Example**:
If website traffic dropped by 40% in March:

* Diagnostic analytics might find that a Google Ads campaign was paused
* A competitor launched a promotion at the same time
* Website loading time increased due to server issues

This provides insights into what factors contributed to the decline.

## 3. **Predictive Analytics**

**Definition**:
Predictive analytics answers: **“What is likely to happen?”**
It uses historical data to build models that forecast future outcomes.

**Goal**:
Anticipate future trends, behavior, or events.

**Techniques Used**:

* Machine learning (classification, regression)
* Time series forecasting
* Statistical modeling
* Predictive modeling tools (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost)

**Example**:
An e-commerce company predicts that:

* Customers aged 25–35 are likely to buy more during summer sales
* Based on past behavior, 20% of users who viewed a product will return to purchase within a week

These predictions guide targeted marketing campaigns.

## 4. **Prescriptive Analytics**

**Definition**:
Prescriptive analytics answers: **“What should we do?”**
It provides **actionable recommendations** by evaluating possible decisions and their outcomes.

**Goal**:
Optimize decision-making based on predicted data.

**Techniques Used**:

* Optimization algorithms
* Simulation models
* Decision trees
* Reinforcement learning

**Example**:
A delivery company wants to reduce fuel costs:

* Prescriptive analytics recommends the optimal route based on real-time traffic, weather, and vehicle capacity
* It might also suggest rescheduling some deliveries to reduce overlap

This allows the company to **act on predictive insights** with confidence.
