### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for IoT Data**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. In the context of **IoT data**, EDA is particularly important due to the volume, variety, and time-based nature of the data.

Below are the key types of EDA applied to IoT data:

---

### **1. Univariate Analysis**

**Definition**: Examining the distribution of a single variable.

**Purpose**:

* Understand data range, central tendency (mean, median, mode), and spread (variance, standard deviation).
* Detect anomalies or outliers in a single sensor or metric.

**Examples**:

* Plotting the temperature readings from a single IoT sensor.
* Histogram of daily electricity usage from a smart meter.

**Techniques**:

* Histograms
* Box plots
* Density plots
* Summary statistics (min, max, mean)

---

### **2. Multivariate Analysis**

**Definition**: Examining relationships between two or more variables.

**Purpose**:

* Discover patterns and correlations among multiple sensors.
* Understand how one variable affects or is related to another.

**Examples**:

* Correlation between temperature and humidity sensors.
* How vibration and load affect energy consumption in industrial equipment.

**Techniques**:

* Scatter plots
* Correlation matrices
* Heatmaps
* Pair plots

---

### **3. Temporal Analysis**

**Definition**: Analyzing data over time.

**Purpose**:

* Detect trends, seasonality, or changes in patterns.
* Monitor sensor behavior and system performance over different time periods.

**Examples**:

* Plotting hourly COâ‚‚ levels in a building over a week.
* Detecting anomalies in electricity consumption over a month.

**Techniques**:

* Time series plots
* Rolling averages
* Seasonal decomposition
* Line plots with time on the x-axis

---

### **4. Spatial Analysis**

**Definition**: Analyzing data in relation to location or geography.

**Purpose**:

* Understand how different locations behave.
* Detect spatial patterns or irregularities in sensor networks.

**Examples**:

* Mapping air quality sensor data across a city.
* Comparing humidity levels in different zones of a smart farm.

**Techniques**:

* Geospatial plots (maps with sensor overlays)
* Heatmaps over geographic coordinates
* Clustering by location

| Type of Analysis | Focus                   | Key Tools/Methods                              | Example                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Univariate**   | Single variable         | Histogram, boxplot, stats summary              | Analyzing only the temperature readings   |
| **Multivariate** | Multiple variables      | Scatterplot, correlation matrix, heatmap       | Temperature vs. humidity correlation      |
| **Temporal**     | Time-based patterns     | Time series plots, rolling mean, decomposition | Weekly usage trend of electricity         |
| **Spatial**      | Location-based patterns | Maps, geo-heatmaps, spatial clustering         | Mapping pollution levels across districts |
