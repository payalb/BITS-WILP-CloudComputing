Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process to handle increasing amounts of work or users efficiently. A scalable system can grow in capacity without a significant drop in performance.  

### Types of Scalability:  
1. **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)** – Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to a single machine.  
2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)** – Adding more machines (servers) to distribute the load.  

### Example:  
- A website with 100 users runs smoothly. If it scales well, it should still run smoothly with 1 million users by adding more servers or optimizing code.  

Scalability is crucial in distributed systems, cloud computing, and databases.
