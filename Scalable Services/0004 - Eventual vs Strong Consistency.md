### **Eventual Consistency vs. Strong Consistency**  

Consistency in distributed systems determines how data is synchronized across multiple nodes. The choice between **eventual** and **strong** consistency depends on trade-offs between speed, availability, and correctness.  

---

### **1. Strong Consistency**  
- Guarantees that **every read returns the latest written value**.  
- Requires synchronization across nodes before confirming a write.  
- Can lead to **higher latency** due to coordination (e.g., Paxos, Raft algorithms).  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:**  
- **Banking systems:** A bank transaction must be immediately visible to all users.  
- **File systems (e.g., Google Drive):** Ensures users always see the latest version of a document.  

ðŸ›‘ **Downside:**  
- Can reduce availability if some nodes are unreachable.

### **2. Eventual Consistency**  
- Allows **temporary inconsistencies** across nodes.  
- Guarantees that all nodes will **eventually** have the latest data if no new updates occur.  
- Improves **availability** and **performance** by reducing coordination overhead.  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:**  
- **Social media feeds:** A post might not appear instantly everywhere but syncs after a few seconds.  
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Updates take time to propagate worldwide.  

âœ… **Benefit:**  
- High availability and low latency.  
ðŸ›‘ **Downside:**  
- Some users may see outdated data.

### **Comparison Table**  

| Feature              | Strong Consistency        | Eventual Consistency  |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Data Accuracy**   | Always up-to-date       | Might be outdated    |
| **Latency**         | High (slower)           | Low (faster)         |
| **Availability**    | Lower                   | Higher               |
| **Use Case**       | Banking, financial apps | Social media, caching |
| **CAP Theorem**    | CP (Consistency, Partition Tolerance) | AP (Availability, Partition Tolerance) |

**Trade-off:**  
- **Strong consistency** ensures correctness but can slow down the system.  
- **Eventual consistency** improves performance and availability but allows temporary inconsistencies.
