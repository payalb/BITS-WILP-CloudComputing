**Mono-Repo vs Multi-Repo**

**Mono-Repo (Monolithic Repository):**
A single version-controlled repository that holds the code for multiple projects, services, or components.

**Advantages:**

* Simplified dependency management and versioning across services.
* Easier code reuse and refactoring.
* Unified tooling and CI/CD pipelines.
* Simplified visibility and collaboration across teams.

**Disadvantages:**

* Repository size can grow significantly, slowing down operations like cloning and searching.
* CI pipelines may become complex and slower if not optimized.
* Enforcing access controls at a granular level is harder.

**Use Cases:**

* When services are tightly coupled and developed by the same team.
* When consistent tooling and shared libraries are heavily used.

---

**Multi-Repo (Multiple Repositories):**
Each service, component, or project has its own dedicated repository.

**Advantages:**

* Smaller, more manageable codebases.
* Teams have full control over their service's lifecycle.
* CI/CD pipelines can be simpler and faster for individual services.
* Easier to enforce access control and permission boundaries.

**Disadvantages:**

* Harder to coordinate changes across services.
* Risk of versioning conflicts and duplication of shared code.
* More overhead in dependency management and release coordination.

**Use Cases:**

* When services are developed and deployed independently.
* When teams are highly decoupled and need autonomy.

**Summary Comparison:**

| Aspect                | Mono-Repo                   | Multi-Repo                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Codebase              | Centralized                 | Distributed                   |
| Team Autonomy         | Lower                       | Higher                        |
| Refactoring           | Easier across services      | Harder, requires coordination |
| Dependency Management | Simplified                  | More complex                  |
| CI/CD Complexity      | Higher (needs optimization) | Lower (per service)           |
| Access Control        | Coarse-grained              | Fine-grained                  |

Choice depends on team size, deployment strategy, and service coupling.
