**Designing Reliable Microservices**

1. **Isolation and Loose Coupling**

   * Services should have minimal dependencies on each other.
   * Failure in one service should not cascade to others.

2. **Well-Defined Contracts (APIs)**

   * Use versioned, backward-compatible APIs.
   * Define clear request/response formats using OpenAPI/Swagger.

3. **Idempotent and Retry-Safe Operations**

   * Make operations idempotent to handle retries without side effects.
   * Implement retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter.

4. **Timeouts and Circuit Breakers**

   * Set timeouts for all external service calls.
   * Use circuit breakers (e.g., Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j) to prevent resource exhaustion.

5. **Graceful Degradation**

   * Provide fallback mechanisms or default responses when dependencies fail.
   * Use cached/stale data where appropriate.

6. **Observability**

   * Implement logging, metrics, and distributed tracing (e.g., using Prometheus, Jaeger).
   * Ensure each request is traceable across services.

7. **Service Health Checks**

   * Expose readiness and liveness probes for each service.
   * Integrate with orchestration platforms (like Kubernetes) for self-healing.

8. **Data Management Strategy**

   * Avoid shared databases. Each service should own its data.
   * Use eventual consistency patterns (e.g., event sourcing, Saga pattern) when strong consistency is not feasible.

9. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**

   * Protect services from overload using rate limiting (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket).
   * Implement quotas per client or tenant.

10. **Secure Communication**

* Use TLS for communication between services.
* Authenticate and authorize each request (e.g., mTLS, OAuth2, API gateways).

11. **Deployment and Rollback Strategies**

* Use blue-green or canary deployments to reduce deployment risks.
* Automate rollbacks on failure detection.

12. **Resilient Storage and Messaging**

* Ensure databases and message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) are highly available and replicated.
* Design consumers to handle message re-delivery and out-of-order processing.

Designing reliable microservices requires combining good software engineering practices with fault-tolerant infrastructure and operational readiness.
