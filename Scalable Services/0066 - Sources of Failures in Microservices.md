**Sources of Failures in Microservices**

1. **Hardware Failures**

   * **Cause:** Physical machine crashes, disk failures, power outages, or infrastructure issues in cloud environments.
   * **Impact:** Service instances may go down, leading to unavailability or degraded performance.
   * **Mitigation:**

     * Use auto-scaling and self-healing infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ASG).
     * Design services to be stateless so they can restart quickly.
     * Distribute services across multiple availability zones or regions.

2. **Communication Failures**

   * **Cause:** Network latency, DNS resolution issues, timeouts, packet drops, or misconfigured load balancers.
   * **Impact:** Requests between services may fail or become delayed, causing service degradation or unresponsiveness.
   * **Mitigation:**

     * Apply timeouts, retries with exponential backoff, and circuit breakers.
     * Use service discovery and resilient communication libraries.
     * Employ health checks and monitoring to detect issues early.

3. **Dependency Failures**

   * **Cause:** Failures in external services such as databases, APIs, authentication servers, or third-party services.
   * **Impact:** A failing dependency can block or crash your service.
   * **Mitigation:**

     * Use bulkheads to isolate failure impact.
     * Implement fallbacks or cached responses.
     * Monitor dependency health and introduce redundancy for critical components.

4. **Internal Failures**

   * **Cause:** Bugs in application logic, resource leaks (e.g., memory or threads), configuration errors, or unhandled exceptions.
   * **Impact:** Leads to crashes, incorrect behavior, or performance degradation.
   * **Mitigation:**

     * Use defensive programming and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, load).
     * Monitor application metrics and logs.
     * Implement structured exception handling and graceful error recovery.

In microservices architectures, reliability depends on anticipating and mitigating failures across these four domains using resilient design patterns, automated recovery, and observability tools.
