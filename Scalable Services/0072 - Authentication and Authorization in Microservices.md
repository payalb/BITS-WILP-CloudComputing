**Authentication and Authorization in Microservices**

1. **Authentication**

   * Verifies the identity of a user or service requesting access.
   * Common methods include OAuth2, OpenID Connect, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and mTLS (mutual TLS).
   * Often handled by a dedicated Identity Provider (IdP) or Authentication Service.

2. **Authorization**

   * Determines whether an authenticated entity has permission to perform a specific action or access a resource.
   * Enforced using policies such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).
   * Can be implemented at multiple levels: API gateway, service mesh, or within each microservice.

3. **Token-Based Authentication**

   * Clients obtain tokens (e.g., JWTs) from an authentication server.
   * Tokens carry user identity and claims, and are included in service requests.
   * Tokens are stateless and can be validated without contacting the authentication server on every request.

4. **Service-to-Service Authentication**

   * Use mutual TLS (mTLS) or signed tokens to authenticate microservices communicating with each other.
   * Prevents unauthorized service access within the system.

5. **Centralized vs Distributed Authorization**

   * **Centralized:** Authorization decisions are made by a dedicated service or gateway, simplifying management but adding a potential bottleneck.
   * **Distributed:** Each microservice enforces authorization independently, improving scalability but requiring consistent policy implementation.

6. **API Gateway and Service Mesh Integration**

   * API gateways often handle authentication and initial authorization checks.
   * Service meshes can enforce mTLS and policy-based authorization transparently between services.

7. **Least Privilege Principle**

   * Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for a user or service to perform its function.
   * Helps minimize the impact of compromised credentials or tokens.

8. **Token Expiration and Refresh**

   * Use short-lived tokens to limit risk exposure.
   * Implement secure refresh token mechanisms to maintain user sessions without frequent logins.

9. **Audit and Logging**

   * Track authentication attempts and authorization decisions for compliance and security monitoring.
   * Helps detect suspicious access patterns and potential breaches.

Effective authentication and authorization are essential for securing microservices architectures by controlling access to sensitive data and operations.
