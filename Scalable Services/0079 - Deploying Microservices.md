**Deploying Microservices – Detailed Overview**

---

### 1. **Deploying Services Without Downtime**

#### **A. Canary Deployments**

**Description:**
A new version of the microservice is deployed to a small subset of users or instances. If the canary performs well, the deployment is gradually expanded to more users or instances.

**Use Case:**

* Releasing a new feature in a production environment with minimal risk.
* Testing system behavior under real traffic before full rollout.

**Pros:**

* Reduces the blast radius of potential failures.
* Enables monitoring real-world metrics (latency, errors) before full deployment.
* Easy to rollback if issues are detected.

**Cons:**

* Requires good monitoring and alerting infrastructure.
* Increases deployment complexity (e.g., routing traffic to specific versions).
* May involve versioning complexities when consumers of the service expect a consistent API.

#### **B. Blue-Green Deployments**

**Description:**
Maintain two identical environments—Blue (current live version) and Green (new version). Deploy the new version to Green, test it, and switch traffic from Blue to Green once ready.

**Use Case:**

* Systems requiring instant switchovers with minimal downtime (e.g., critical applications, financial systems).
* Testing new versions in production-like environments before going live.

**Pros:**

* Instant rollback capability.
* Zero downtime during deployment.
* Pre-deployment testing in a production-like environment.

**Cons:**

* Requires double the infrastructure capacity.
* Costlier to maintain parallel environments.
* Risk of database incompatibility if schema changes are not backward compatible.

#### **C. Rolling Deployments**

**Description:**
Gradually replace old instances of a microservice with new ones, one or a few at a time, until the whole system is updated.

**Use Case:**

* Frequently updated services where full redeployment isn't feasible.
* Kubernetes-based systems using rolling updates for pods.

**Pros:**

* Requires less infrastructure than Blue-Green.
* No service downtime.
* Continuous delivery-friendly.

**Cons:**

* Harder to rollback if not configured with version tracking.
* Users may hit inconsistent versions during rollout unless routing is managed.
* Monitoring and automation are required for safe progression.

### 2. **Serverless Deployment for Microservices**

**Description:**
Deploy microservices as functions or serverless components without managing infrastructure. Execution is triggered by events (e.g., HTTP requests, file uploads, message queues).

**Use Case:**

* Lightweight APIs (e.g., image resizing, authentication handlers).
* Event-driven tasks (e.g., processing uploaded files, IoT data handling).
* Intermittently-used services or background jobs.

**Platforms:**

* AWS Lambda + API Gateway
* Azure Functions
* Google Cloud Functions
* Cloudflare Workers (edge serverless)

**Pros:**

* No infrastructure management (auto-scaling, provisioning, patching).
* Pay-per-use pricing—cost-effective for low/medium-traffic services.
* High availability and fault tolerance built-in.

**Cons:**

* Cold start latency for infrequent functions.
* Limited execution time and memory.
* Complex testing and debugging due to distributed nature.
* Vendor lock-in and platform-specific restrictions.
* Harder to apply advanced routing and deployment strategies like Blue-Green directly.

**Example Use Case Breakdown:**

| Scenario                                                       | Preferred Strategy |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Launching a new version of a high-traffic microservice         | Canary or Rolling  |
| Deploying a simple notification microservice                   | Serverless         |
| Critical financial application with strict uptime requirements | Blue-Green         |
| Scheduled data aggregation job                                 | Serverless         |
| Gradual rollout of an experimental feature                     | Canary             |
| Updating a stateless API on Kubernetes                         | Rolling            |

Each deployment approach has its trade-offs. Choosing the right one depends on risk tolerance, infrastructure budget, system complexity, and observability maturity. A hybrid strategy is often used in real-world scalable systems.
