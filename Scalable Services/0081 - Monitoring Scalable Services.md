**Monitoring Scalable Services**

Monitoring is critical for maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of scalable services, especially in distributed systems like microservices. It involves collecting, visualizing, and analyzing data about the system's behavior in real time.

### **Key Monitoring Aspects**

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**

   * Tracks CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of servers, containers, or VMs.
   * Ensures resource usage is within acceptable thresholds to avoid bottlenecks.
   * Tools: Prometheus + Node Exporter, Datadog, AWS CloudWatch.

2. **Application Monitoring**

   * Measures application-level metrics such as response times, error rates, and request counts.
   * Detects slow services, unresponsive APIs, and memory leaks.
   * Tools: Prometheus, New Relic, Dynatrace, AppDynamics.

3. **Log Monitoring**

   * Captures and analyzes logs to understand system events and errors.
   * Enables debugging and auditing.
   * Tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd, Loki + Grafana.

4. **Distributed Tracing**

   * Visualizes the flow of requests across microservices.
   * Helps identify latency bottlenecks and trace errors through service chains.
   * Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry.

5. **Health Checks & Alerting**

   * Health probes monitor service readiness and liveness.
   * Alerting systems notify teams of anomalies or failures.
   * Tools: Prometheus Alertmanager, PagerDuty, Grafana Alerting.

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**

* **Latency**: Response time per request.
* **Throughput**: Number of requests handled per second.
* **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests.
* **CPU/Memory Usage**: System-level resource consumption.
* **Saturation**: Queues or thread pool usage indicating overload.
* **Availability/Uptime**: Percentage of time the service is operational.

---

### **Best Practices**

* Use the **Four Golden Signals**: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation.
* Implement **centralized logging** and **metric aggregation** for observability across services.
* Set up **dashboards** for real-time visibility and trend analysis.
* Use **automated alerting** to detect and respond to issues quickly.
* Integrate monitoring into **CI/CD pipelines** to validate deployments.
