**Monitoring in Scalable Services**

Monitoring is essential for ensuring reliability, performance, and operational insight into services, particularly in scalable and distributed architectures like microservices. Effective monitoring involves more than just data collection—it also requires thoughtful instrumentation and actionable alerting.

### **1. Collecting Metrics**

**Definition:**
Collecting quantitative data about the behavior of a system, such as request rates, error counts, latency, CPU usage, and memory consumption.

**Types of Metrics:**

* **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic.
* **Application Metrics**: Request count, latency, error rate.
* **Business Metrics**: Transactions per second, user registrations, revenue events.

**How It's Done:**

* **Agents/Exporters**: Tools like Prometheus Node Exporter, cAdvisor, or StatsD collect system-level data.
* **Application Libraries**: SDKs for languages (e.g., Prometheus client for Python, Java, Go) expose custom application metrics.
* **Service Mesh Telemetry**: Automatically collect metrics like request latency and errors across services (e.g., Istio + Prometheus).

**Recommended Practices:**

* Use consistent naming conventions for metrics.
* Collect high-cardinality metrics (like per-customer stats) cautiously.
* Separate high-frequency (technical) from low-frequency (business) metrics.
* Use time-series databases (e.g., Prometheus) for storing and querying metrics.

**Use in Scalable Systems:**

* Capacity planning based on CPU/memory trends.
* Identifying service hot spots from request traffic metrics.
* Detecting system degradation by analyzing latency and error rates.

### **2. Instrumenting**

**Definition:**
Adding code or configuration to your services to expose useful metrics, traces, and logs.

**What to Instrument:**

* **Request Handlers**: Log start/end time, success/failure, input/output.
* **External Calls**: Track latency and error rates of calls to databases, APIs, or third-party services.
* **Critical Business Logic**: Record important business events like failed payments or account creations.

**Methods:**

* **Manual Instrumentation**: Developers explicitly add metric/log statements in code.
* **Auto-Instrumentation**: Middleware or libraries (e.g., OpenTelemetry) automatically trace and measure standard operations.
* **Sidecar Proxies**: In service meshes, proxies like Envoy collect telemetry transparently.

**Recommended Practices:**

* Use **structured logging** (e.g., JSON) for machine parsing.
* Instrument key business transactions and user flows.
* Annotate traces with metadata for filtering and correlation.
* Integrate instrumentation early in the development lifecycle.

**Use in Scalable Systems:**

* Trace request flows across microservices.
* Debug performance issues with per-component latency.
* Monitor business KPIs with minimal manual data correlation.

### **3. Raising Sensible & Actionable Alerts**

**Definition:**
Sending alerts when predefined conditions are met, allowing teams to detect and respond to issues early.

**Types of Alerts:**

* **Threshold-based**: e.g., CPU > 90% for 5 minutes.
* **Anomaly-based**: e.g., sudden spike in 500 errors.
* **Rate of Change**: e.g., traffic drops 50% within 10 minutes.
* **Multi-condition Alerts**: e.g., latency + error rate + saturation combined.

**Best Practices:**

* **Avoid Alert Fatigue**: Only alert on symptoms that require action.
* **Use Severity Levels**: Informational, Warning, Critical.
* **Correlate Alerts**: Group related alerts to reduce noise.
* **Test Alert Conditions**: Simulate conditions to avoid false positives/negatives.
* **Automate Escalation**: Integrate with systems like PagerDuty or Opsgenie.

**Actionable Alert Examples:**

* "500 error rate > 5% for more than 3 minutes" → Investigate service health.
* "CPU usage > 90% and increasing latency" → Possible overload, scale out.
* "No traffic to service in 10 minutes" → Possible crash or routing issue.

**Use in Scalable Systems:**

* Prevent outages by alerting before full system failure.
* Reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) with focused, relevant alerts.
* Maintain SLOs and SLAs by enforcing performance thresholds.
