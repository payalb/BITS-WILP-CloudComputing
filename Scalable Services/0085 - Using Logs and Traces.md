**Using Logs & Traces in Scalable Services**

Logs and traces are fundamental components of observability in scalable systems. They provide visibility into how services behave over time and interact with each other. Proper use of logs and distributed tracing enables efficient debugging, root cause analysis, and performance optimization.

### **1. Useful Info in Log Entries**

Logs should be structured, informative, and context-rich. Effective logs allow developers and operators to reconstruct what happened in the system at any point in time.

**What to Include in Log Entries:**

* **Timestamp**: Accurate time of the event.
* **Log level**: e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL.
* **Service/Component name**: To identify the log source.
* **Request ID / Correlation ID**: To trace a request across services.
* **User ID / Session ID**: To link logs to specific users (if applicable).
* **Contextual metadata**: Route, HTTP status, operation type, database query summary.
* **Error stack traces**: For debugging failures.
* **Event-specific data**: E.g., payment amount, order ID, etc.

**Best Practices:**

* Use **structured logs** (e.g., JSON) for better parsing and indexing.
* Avoid logging sensitive data (PII, credentials).
* Use consistent log formats across services.
* Include **log levels** wisely â€” avoid excessive DEBUG logs in production.

### **2. Tools for Logging**

**Log Collection & Aggregation:**

* **Fluentd**, **Logstash**, **Filebeat**: Log shippers that forward logs to centralized storage.
* **Vector**: High-performance log pipeline.

**Log Storage & Search:**

* **Elasticsearch**: Scalable log indexing and full-text search engine.
* **Loki**: Lightweight logging backend designed for Grafana integration.
* **Cloud-native solutions**: AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor.

**Visualization:**

* **Kibana**: GUI frontend for Elasticsearch.
* **Grafana**: Used with Loki or Elasticsearch for viewing logs and correlating with metrics.

**Best Practices:**

* Centralize logs from all instances and services.
* Retain logs with an appropriate retention policy.
* Use indexing and filtering to optimize search performance.

### **3. Logging the Right Information**

Logging too much clutters storage and slows down analysis; logging too little makes debugging difficult.

**What to Log:**

* Incoming requests and their metadata.
* Key business events (e.g., payment processed).
* Errors, exceptions, and stack traces.
* Retry attempts, timeouts, and circuit breaker activations.
* External service interactions (e.g., outgoing HTTP calls).

**What *Not* to Log:**

* Sensitive information: passwords, tokens, credit card data.
* Redundant or noisy debug logs in production.
* High-frequency operations (e.g., per-loop logs) unless sampled.

**Best Practices:**

* Use context-aware logging (e.g., use middleware to enrich logs).
* Tag logs with service and environment metadata (e.g., `service=auth`, `env=prod`).
* Enable log rotation and size limits.

### **4. Tracing Interaction Between Services**

**Distributed tracing** captures the path of a single request across multiple services, providing end-to-end visibility.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Trace**: A complete path of a request through a system.
* **Span**: A single unit of work within a trace (e.g., one HTTP call, one DB query).
* **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for the entire request path.
* **Parent-Child Span Relationship**: Describes how calls are nested and related.

**How It Works:**

* Instrument code with tracing libraries (manually or via middleware).
* Pass trace context headers (`trace-id`, `span-id`) between services.
* Collect and store spans for analysis.

**Standards & Tools:**

* **OpenTelemetry**: Standard framework for traces, metrics, and logs.
* **Jaeger**, **Zipkin**: Open-source tracing systems.
* **AWS X-Ray**, **Google Cloud Trace**, **Datadog APM**: Managed tracing platforms.

**Use Cases:**

* Diagnose slow requests by identifying the slowest span.
* Detect failure propagation through services.
* Understand inter-service dependencies and request fan-outs.

### **5. Visualizing Traces**

Trace visualizations help teams understand service call chains, latencies, and bottlenecks.

**Trace Visualization Tools:**

* **Jaeger UI**: Timeline and service graph views.
* **Zipkin UI**: Trace waterfall view.
* **Grafana Tempo**: Trace storage backend with visualization support.
* **Datadog APM**, **New Relic**, **AppDynamics**: Commercial platforms with UI-rich trace viewers.

**Features of Trace UIs:**

* Flame graphs: Show how time is spent across spans.
* Dependency graphs: Map service interactions.
* Trace filtering: By trace ID, service name, or error status.

**Best Practices:**

* Always propagate trace headers across HTTP/gRPC calls.
* Add meaningful span names and metadata.
* Visualize critical paths regularly to identify architectural inefficiencies.
