**Kubernetes in Scalable Services**

Kubernetes (K8s) is a powerful open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, management, and monitoring of containerized applications. It is widely used in scalable systems to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization.

### **What is Kubernetes?**

**Definition:**
Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that manages containerized applications across clusters of machines.

**Core Features:**

* Automates container deployment, scaling, and operations.
* Self-healing (restarts failed containers, reschedules on node failure).
* Service discovery and load balancing.
* Declarative configuration and desired state management.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit; encapsulates one or more containers.
* **Deployments**: Manage updates and scaling of pods.
* **Services**: Expose pods to other services or the internet.
* **Nodes**: Machines (VMs or physical) that run workloads.
* **Control Plane**: Manages the cluster (scheduler, controller manager, API server, etcd).

### **Deployment of Microservices using Kubernetes**

**Approach:**

* Each microservice is containerized (e.g., via Docker) and deployed in a separate pod.
* Services expose APIs internally or externally using Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress).
* ConfigMaps and Secrets manage environment-specific data.

**Deployment Workflow:**

1. Build and containerize each microservice.
2. Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for:

   * Deployments
   * Services
   * Ingress rules
3. Apply manifests using `kubectl apply`.

**Benefits:**

* Declarative deployments: Define desired state in code.
* Rolling updates and rollbacks.
* Simplified horizontal scaling.

### **Scalability in Kubernetes**

**Horizontal Scaling:**

* Scale pods up/down based on load using the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**.
* Triggered by CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

**Vertical Scaling:**

* Adjust resources (CPU/memory) for containers, though less common for autoscaling.

**Cluster Scaling:**

* **Cluster Autoscaler** adds/removes nodes based on pending pods.
* Works with cloud providers (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS).

**Best Practices:**

* Use **resource requests and limits** to guide scheduling.
* Use metrics server and custom metrics for autoscaling.
* Design stateless services for easier horizontal scaling.

### **Security in Kubernetes**

**Key Security Features:**

* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Controls who can access what resources.
* **Network Policies**: Define communication rules between pods.
* **Secrets Management**: Securely store sensitive information (API keys, DB passwords).
* **Pod Security Standards**: Define policies (e.g., prevent running as root).
* **TLS and Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: Encrypt traffic between services.

**Best Practices:**

* Use namespaces to isolate environments.
* Regularly update and patch the Kubernetes version and components.
* Restrict container capabilities and enforce read-only file systems.
* Use container image scanners (e.g., Trivy) to catch vulnerabilities.

### **CI/CD using Kubernetes**

**CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**

* Kubernetes integrates with CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, ArgoCD, Flux).
* Pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying services to the cluster.

**Process:**

1. Developer pushes code to Git.
2. CI pipeline runs tests, builds container image, pushes to registry.
3. CD pipeline updates Kubernetes manifests (possibly via GitOps).
4. Kubernetes performs rolling updates.

**GitOps Tools:**

* **ArgoCD**, **Flux**: Use Git as the source of truth for deployments.
* Declarative, automated, and auditable deployment process.

**Best Practices:**

* Use Helm or Kustomize for templating Kubernetes manifests.
* Validate manifests using tools like `kubeval` or `OPA Gatekeeper`.
* Canary or blue/green deployments to minimize downtime.

### **Kubernetes Dashboard**

**Definition:**
A web-based UI for managing and monitoring Kubernetes clusters.

**Features:**

* View and manage workloads (pods, deployments, services).
* Inspect logs and events.
* Scale deployments or restart pods.
* Visualize resource usage and cluster health.

**Security Considerations:**

* Dashboard should be protected via authentication (e.g., token-based or OAuth).
* Restrict access with RBAC.
* Avoid exposing the dashboard publicly without a secure ingress setup.

**Best Practices:**

* Prefer CLI or GitOps for production changes; use Dashboard for visualization and debugging.
* Monitor dashboard usage and audit logs.
