**CI/CD With Kubernetes**

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications in Kubernetes environments, enabling faster and reliable delivery of software.

### CI/CD Workflow with Kubernetes

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**

   * Developers push code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
   * CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI) automatically build container images.
   * Automated tests (unit, integration) run to validate code quality.
   * On success, container images are pushed to a container registry.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**

   * Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts define how applications are deployed.
   * CD tools monitor container registry or Git repositories for new image versions or config changes.
   * New versions of applications are deployed to Kubernetes clusters using strategies like rolling updates, blue-green, or canary deployments.
   * Health checks and readiness probes ensure only healthy pods serve traffic.

### Deployment Strategies Supported in Kubernetes CI/CD

* **Rolling Updates:** Gradually replace old pods with new versions without downtime.
* **Blue-Green Deployment:** Deploy new version alongside the old, then switch traffic.
* **Canary Deployment:** Release new version to a small subset of users before full rollout.
* **A/B Testing and Ramped Deployments:** Gradually increase traffic to new versions based on performance metrics.

### Tools Commonly Used

* **CI Tools:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, Travis CI, CircleCI
* **Container Registries:** Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry
* **CD Tools:** Argo CD, Flux, Spinnaker, Helm
* **Kubernetes Management:** kubectl, Helm charts, Kustomize

### Best Practices

* Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Kubernetes manifests.
* Automate testing at multiple stages to catch issues early.
* Secure credentials and secrets in pipelines using Kubernetes Secrets or external vaults.
* Monitor deployments and implement rollback mechanisms.
* Integrate security scans in CI/CD pipelines for images and code.

CI/CD with Kubernetes enables efficient, automated, and reliable software delivery by combining containerization, orchestration, and modern deployment strategies.
