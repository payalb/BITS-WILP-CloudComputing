### **Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Controls in Cybersecurity**  

Understanding the relationship between **vulnerabilities, threats, and controls** is essential for securing systems.  

---

## **1. Vulnerabilities** 🛑  
A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by attackers.  

### **Types of Vulnerabilities**  
- **Software Vulnerabilities** – Bugs, unpatched software, buffer overflows.  
- **Weak Authentication** – Poor password policies, no MFA.  
- **Misconfiguration** – Publicly exposed databases, weak firewall settings.  
- **Human Errors** – Clicking phishing links, accidental data exposure.  
- **Lack of Encryption** – Storing sensitive data in plain text.  

✔ **Example:** SQL injection is a vulnerability in databases that allows attackers to manipulate queries.  

---

## **2. Threats** ⚠️  
A **threat** is a potential danger that exploits a vulnerability to cause harm.  

### **Types of Threats**  
- **Cyber Attacks** – Hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing.  
- **Insider Threats** – Employees stealing or misusing data.  
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks** – Overloading systems to make them unavailable.  
- **Data Breaches** – Unauthorized access leading to data leaks.  
- **Natural Disasters** – Earthquakes, fires, or floods damaging infrastructure.  

✔ **Example:** A hacker exploiting an unpatched software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.

## **3. Controls (Mitigations)** 🔐  
A **control** is a security measure used to reduce risk by fixing vulnerabilities or preventing threats.  

### **Types of Controls**  
| **Type**          | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Preventive**   | Stops threats before they happen. | Firewalls, MFA, encryption. |
| **Detective**    | Identifies threats when they occur. | Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), logging, monitoring. |
| **Corrective**   | Fixes issues after an attack. | Incident response plans, backup recovery. |
| **Compensating** | Alternative controls if primary security measures fail. | Security awareness training, air-gapped systems. |

✔ **Example:** Using **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** to prevent unauthorized access.

### **Real-World Example**  
**Scenario:** A company stores sensitive customer data in a cloud database.  

- **Vulnerability:** The database is misconfigured and publicly accessible.  
- **Threat:** Hackers can scan for exposed databases and steal sensitive data.  
- **Control:** Configure **access controls**, enable **encryption**, and use **intrusion detection systems (IDS)** to monitor access.  

By identifying vulnerabilities, understanding threats, and applying proper controls, organizations can **reduce risks and improve security**.
