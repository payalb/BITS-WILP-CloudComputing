The **SAFECode Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development** is a comprehensive guide aimed at enhancing software security throughout the development lifecycle. Published in March 2018 by the Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode), this third edition incorporates updates reflecting current best practices and introduces new considerations in areas such as third-party components, security issue management, and vulnerability response and disclosure.

**Key Highlights of the Guide:**

- **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) Integration:** Emphasizes embedding security practices at every stage of the software development process to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Third-Party Component Management:** Provides guidance on assessing and managing risks associated with using third-party components, both open-source and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), ensuring they do not introduce vulnerabilities into the software.

- **Security Issue Management:** Outlines strategies for effectively tracking, prioritizing, and remediating security issues, including defining severity levels and establishing risk acceptance processes.

- **Vulnerability Response and Disclosure:** Details processes for responding to and disclosing vulnerabilities, including defining internal and external policies, roles and responsibilities, and managing relationships with vulnerability reporters.

This guide serves as a foundational resource for organizations aiming to implement or enhance their secure software development practices, offering practical, real-world insights from SAFECode members across diverse development environments.
