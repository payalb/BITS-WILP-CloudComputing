### **DevSecOps: Integrating Security into DevOps**  

**DevSecOps** (Development, Security, and Operations) is a methodology that integrates security into the **DevOps** process to ensure secure software delivery **without slowing down development**. It automates security checks and **"shifts security left"** (earlier in the SDLC) to catch vulnerabilities **before deployment**.

## üîπ **Key Principles of DevSecOps**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Shift Left Security**
   - Identify and fix vulnerabilities **early** in the development cycle instead of after deployment.  
   - Use **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** during coding and **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** in testing.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Security as Code**
   - Security policies and compliance rules are automated and written as code.  
   - Example: **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation ensure security configurations.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Security Monitoring**
   - Logs, audit trails, and real-time alerts help detect threats.  
   - Example tools: **Splunk, ELK Stack, AWS GuardDuty, SIEM solutions**  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Security Testing**
   - **SAST (Static Analysis):** Scans source code (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx).  
   - **DAST (Dynamic Analysis):** Tests running applications (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite).  
   - **SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** Scans open-source libraries (e.g., Snyk, Black Duck).  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Integrate security scans in **CI/CD workflows** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).  
   - Automated secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

## üîπ **DevSecOps Workflow in CI/CD**
1. **Developers** write code and commit to GitHub/GitLab.
2. **Automated security scans** (SAST, SCA) detect vulnerabilities.
3. **Build & Container Security** checks (e.g., Docker scanning).
4. **Automated DAST and penetration testing** in staging.
5. **Infrastructure Security Checks** for misconfigurations.
6. **Deployment with security monitoring** (e.g., SIEM, Cloud Security tools).
7. **Continuous monitoring and patching** post-deployment.
