### **Shift Left vs. Shift Right in Software Development**  

Both **Shift Left** and **Shift Right** are strategies to improve software quality and security, but they focus on **different stages** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  

| Approach  | **Shift Left** ðŸ”„ | **Shift Right** ðŸ”„ |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Focus** | Catch issues **early** in SDLC. | Detect and fix issues **after deployment**. |
| **Testing Phase** | Unit testing, static analysis, security scanning during **development**. | Real-world testing, monitoring, and security checks in **production**. |
| **Goal** | **Prevent** bugs & vulnerabilities. | **Detect & respond** to issues dynamically. |
| **Techniques** | **SAST (Static Analysis), SCA (Dependency Scanning), Automated Security Testing, CI/CD Security**. | **DAST (Dynamic Analysis), Penetration Testing, Observability, A/B Testing, Chaos Engineering**. |
| **Examples** | - Using **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** early in development.  <br> - Running **automated security tests** in CI/CD. <br> - Secure coding best practices. | - **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**. <br> - **Penetration Testing & Red Teaming**. <br> - **Observability tools** (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog). |

## **How They Work Together**
- **Shift Left** improves security **before release**, reducing the cost of fixing vulnerabilities.  
- **Shift Right** ensures **resilience and continuous monitoring** in production.  
- **DevSecOps integrates both**: Security is automated **(Shift Left)** but also monitored continuously **(Shift Right)**.
