### **Shift Left Approach in Software Development**  

The **Shift Left** approach means **moving testing, security, and quality assurance earlier in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. Instead of detecting issues late (during testing or production), developers identify and fix them as early as possible, reducing costs and improving security.

## üîπ **Why Shift Left?**  
‚úÖ **Catch issues early** ‚Üí Fixing bugs in development is **cheaper** than in production.  
‚úÖ **Improve security** ‚Üí Detect vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.  
‚úÖ **Faster delivery** ‚Üí Reduce delays caused by late-stage fixes.  
‚úÖ **Higher quality** ‚Üí Deliver **stable, secure software** from the start.

## üîπ **Shift Left Strategies**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Early Security & Testing Integration**
- Perform **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** during coding.  
- Use **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** to check third-party dependencies.  
- Apply **Threat Modeling** before development starts.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Developer-Led Testing**
- Developers write **unit tests** and **integration tests** before coding (**Test-Driven Development - TDD**).  
- Implement **code reviews with security checks** (e.g., GitHub CodeQL, SonarQube).  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Security in CI/CD**
- Add security scans to **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipelines.  
- Automate **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security checks**.  
- Enforce **secrets management** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Feedback Loops**
- **Developers get instant feedback** from automated testing.  
- **Security teams collaborate** from the start instead of at the end.  
- Use **shift left observability** to monitor performance & security in early environments.

## üîπ **Shift Left in DevSecOps**
| **Phase** | **Traditional SDLC** üïë | **Shift Left SDLC** ‚è© |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Security Testing** | Happens at the **end** before deployment. | Happens **throughout** the SDLC. |
| **Bug Fixing** | **Expensive** late-stage fixes. | **Cheaper** early-stage fixes. |
| **Responsibility** | Security & QA teams handle security. | **Developers own security & quality**. |
