### **Types of Shift Left Approach in Testing**  

The **Shift Left** approach has different variations based on how early testing is integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Each type focuses on different aspects of **early testing and security**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Traditional Shift Left Testing**  
📌 **Focus:** Moving testing **from the end of SDLC** to **earlier stages**.  
📌 **Best for:** **Waterfall or V-model** projects with **defined requirements**.  

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Testing is moved from **after development** to **during development**.  
- **Unit and integration testing** are performed alongside coding.  
- **Test plans** are created early based on requirements.  

🔹 **Example:**  
- In a **Waterfall project**, functional testing starts in the **design phase** rather than waiting until after development is complete.

## **2️⃣ Incremental Shift Left Testing**  
📌 **Focus:** Testing is integrated **incrementally** as the system grows.  
📌 **Best for:** Large, **complex systems** developed in **phases**.  

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Each **module/component** is tested separately **before integration**.  
- Helps identify issues **before integrating large systems**.  
- Used for **hardware-software integration** (e.g., embedded systems).  

🔹 **Example:**  
- A **self-driving car software** is tested in small increments (e.g., braking system, navigation) before full vehicle integration.

## **3️⃣ Agile/DevOps Shift Left Testing**  
📌 **Focus:** Continuous, **automated testing in CI/CD pipelines**.  
📌 **Best for:** **Agile & DevOps teams** working on **rapid releases**.  

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Testing is **fully integrated into CI/CD** workflows.  
- Uses **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**.  
- Automates **security, performance, and functional testing** in development.  

🔹 **Example:**  
- In a **DevOps team**, every Git commit triggers **automated tests** before deployment.

## **4️⃣ Model-Based Shift Left Testing**  
📌 **Focus:** Using **models** (diagrams, workflows) to design and test systems **before coding starts**.  
📌 **Best for:** **Highly regulated industries** (e.g., finance, healthcare).  

🔹 **How It Works:**  
- **Simulates and tests designs** before writing code.  
- Identifies **logical flaws and security risks** before implementation.  
- Uses **UML diagrams, state machines, and data flow models**.  

🔹 **Example:**  
- A **banking system** is modeled and tested for security risks **before development** starts.

### **Comparison of Shift Left Types**  

| **Type** | **Best for** | **Testing Approach** | **Example Use Case** |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Traditional Shift Left** | Waterfall projects | Moves testing to earlier SDLC phases | Web application testing in Waterfall |
| **Incremental Shift Left** | Large modular systems | Tests each module separately before integration | IoT devices, Embedded Systems |
| **Agile/DevOps Shift Left** | Agile & DevOps teams | Continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines | Automated cloud deployments |
| **Model-Based Shift Left** | Regulated industries | Uses **models & simulations** before coding | Banking, Aerospace, Healthcare |
