### **Security Assurance Maturity Models**  

Security Assurance Maturity Models (SAMMs) **help organizations assess, improve, and integrate security practices** into software development and operations. These models provide structured frameworks to measure security maturity across different domains.

## 🔹 **Popular Security Assurance Maturity Models**  

### **1️⃣ OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)**  
📌 **Focus:** Secure software development **practices and governance**.  
📌 **Best for:** **Organizations of all sizes** looking to integrate security into SDLC.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Covers **governance, design, implementation, verification, and operations**.  
- Provides a **maturity roadmap** for security improvement.  
- **Flexible and scalable**—can be adapted to any development methodology.  

🔹 **Maturity Levels:**  
| **Level** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Level 1** | **Ad-hoc** security practices, minimal security awareness. |
| **Level 2** | **Defined** security processes, some automation. |
| **Level 3** | **Optimized** security with continuous improvement. |

🔹 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **startup** begins with basic security testing (**Level 1**).  
- As they grow, they implement **automated security scanning** (**Level 2**).  
- At full maturity, they integrate **threat modeling & continuous security monitoring** (**Level 3**).

### **2️⃣ BSIMM (Building Security In Maturity Model)**  
📌 **Focus:** Measures **real-world security practices** in organizations.  
📌 **Best for:** **Enterprises** wanting to benchmark security maturity.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- Based on **observations from real-world companies**.  
- Focuses on **actual security behaviors**, not just theoretical best practices.  
- **Compares security practices** across industries.  

🔹 **Maturity Levels:**  
| **Level** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Level 1** | Security practices are **informal & reactive**. |
| **Level 2** | Some **defined security activities** exist. |
| **Level 3** | Security is **integrated & automated** into workflows. |

🔹 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **tech company** wants to **compare its security practices** with industry leaders.  
- Uses **BSIMM** to assess security maturity and **adopt best practices**.

### **3️⃣ CMMI-SVC (Capability Maturity Model Integration for Services)**  
📌 **Focus:** **Security in IT services and managed operations**.  
📌 **Best for:** Organizations with **cloud, DevOps, and IT service management**.  

🔹 **Key Features:**  
- **Process-driven** approach to **security and service management**.  
- Covers **risk management, incident response, and compliance**.  
- Uses **structured levels** to improve security maturity.  

🔹 **Maturity Levels:**  
| **Level** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Level 1** | **Unstructured, inconsistent** security. |
| **Level 2** | **Some formal processes** exist but lack enforcement. |
| **Level 3** | **Defined and repeatable** security practices. |
| **Level 4** | Security processes are **measured and controlled**. |
| **Level 5** | Security is **optimized and continuously improved**. |

🔹 **Example Use Case:**  
- A **cloud service provider** follows **CMMI-SVC** to ensure **secure DevOps practices** and compliance.
