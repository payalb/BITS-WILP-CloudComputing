### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Functional Security Requirements**  
These requirements focus on the **overall behavior** and **resilience** of the product.

- **Availability:**  
  - **High Availability** (HA) design, ensuring minimal downtime.  
  - **Distributed architecture** for fault tolerance.

- **Performance and Scalability:**  
  - Ensure product can **scale securely** under increased traffic or load.  
  - Conduct **stress testing** for performance under attack.

- **Resilience:**  
  - **Incident response** and **disaster recovery** planning.  
  - **Backup and restore mechanisms** in place.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Compliance Requirements**  
These ensure the product meets industry or regulatory standards.

- **Data Protection Regulations:**  
  - **GDPR** compliance for handling personal data of EU citizens.  
  - **CCPA** compliance for handling California residents' data.

- **Industry-Specific Compliance:**  
  - **HIPAA** for healthcare-related products.  
  - **PCI DSS** for payment processing systems.

- **Vulnerability Management Standards:**  
  - Regular **security patching** and **vulnerability scans**.  
  - Adherence to **OWASP Top 10** security practices.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Requirements**  
Security must be integrated throughout the SDLC.

- **Threat Modeling:**  
  - Early identification of security threats during the design phase.  
  - Use of tools like **OWASP Threat Dragon** or **Microsoft SDL Threat Modeling Tool**.

- **Secure Coding Practices:**  
  - Follow **OWASP Secure Coding Practices** (e.g., input validation, output encoding).  
  - Regular code reviews and static code analysis (e.g., **SonarQube**, **Checkmarx**).

- **Security Testing:**  
  - Implement **dynamic analysis** (DAST), **static analysis** (SAST), and **penetration testing**.  
  - Regular security regression tests.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Operational Security Requirements**  
These requirements focus on ensuring the product remains secure **during its operational phase**.

- **Patch Management:**  
  - Quick identification and remediation of vulnerabilities through regular patching.  
  - **Automated patching systems** and **change management processes**.

- **Incident Response Plan:**  
  - A documented and regularly tested plan to handle potential **security breaches**.  
  - Defined **escalation paths** and **forensic analysis** capabilities.

- **Monitoring and Detection:**  
  - Continuous monitoring of **network traffic, logs, and user behavior**.  
  - Use of **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** systems.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy Requirements**  
Ensures the product respects user privacy and complies with privacy laws.

- **Data Minimization:**  
  - Collect only necessary personal data.  
  - Implement **anonymization** and **pseudonymization** techniques where possible.

- **User Consent and Control:**  
  - Obtain user consent for data collection and usage (e.g., **cookie consent**).  
  - Provide users with options to **access, modify, or delete** their data.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Supply Chain Requirements**  
Ensures security throughout the product's supply chain.

- **Vendor and Third-Party Security:**  
  - Conduct **vendor security assessments** and enforce **third-party contracts** with security obligations.  
  - Ensure that third-party components, like **open-source libraries**, are **vetted and updated** regularly.

- **Integrity of Software Deliverables:**  
  - Ensure software and updates are delivered via **trusted channels**.  
  - **Code signing** to verify the integrity of software delivered to customers.

---

## üîπ **Key Considerations for Defining Security Requirements**

### **1. Threat Landscape Assessment**
- Regularly evaluate the **threat landscape** (e.g., new attack vectors, vulnerabilities).  
- Align security requirements based on the **risk profile** of the product.

### **2. Security by Design**
- **Integrate security early** in the design process to prevent issues from arising later.  
- Apply **defense in depth** (multiple layers of security) in the product design.

### **3. Collaboration Across Teams**
- Security requirements should be defined and enforced through collaboration between **development, operations, and security** teams.  
- Incorporate security **champions** within each team.

| **Requirement**                  | **Description**                             | **Priority** |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Authentication**               | Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication** for all users. | High         |
| **Encryption**                   | Ensure **AES-256 encryption** for sensitive data at rest and in transit. | High         |
| **Logging & Monitoring**         | Log all system events and monitor logs for **suspicious activities**. | Medium       |
| **Compliance**                   | Ensure **GDPR compliance** for handling user data in the EU. | High         |
| **Incident Response**            | Develop and test an **incident response plan**. | Medium       |
