### **Types of Baselines**

In security and systems management, a **baseline** refers to a **standard set of configurations, rules, or guidelines** that establish an acceptable level of security, performance, or functionality. Baselines help organizations maintain consistency and manage changes effectively. There are several types of baselines, each serving a specific purpose depending on the domain or area of focus.

  Specifies configurations for network devices (e.g., routers, switches) and defines secure communication protocols, access control measures, and monitoring techniques.

- **Cloud Security Baseline**  
  Focuses on security for cloud environments, including **identity and access management (IAM)**, data protection, encryption, and compliance with cloud provider security standards.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure consistency and compliance with security practices and to protect systems from unauthorized access, attacks, and vulnerabilities.

## üîπ **2Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration Baselines**

Configuration baselines refer to the **standard settings and configurations** required to ensure that systems are set up properly and function as intended. They are often used in system administration and IT management.

### **Key Types:**

- **Operating System Baseline**  
  Specifies the configuration of an operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux), including system settings, security configurations, and necessary software patches.

- **Network Configuration Baseline**  
  Defines the standard configuration of network devices like routers, firewalls, and switches, ensuring secure and optimal network performance.

- **Hardware Configuration Baseline**  
  Specifies the standard setup for hardware components (e.g., servers, storage devices) in terms of firmware, network interfaces, and system settings.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that systems are configured consistently and are in compliance with best practices. It helps in tracking and managing changes over time.

## üîπ **3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Baselines**

A performance baseline establishes the **expected performance metrics** for a system, application, or network. These baselines help monitor and evaluate the system's performance over time.

### **Key Types:**

- **Application Performance Baseline**  
  Specifies the expected performance metrics of an application, such as **response times**, **resource usage**, and **error rates** under normal usage.

- **System Performance Baseline**  
  Focuses on the performance of an entire system (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O) under expected loads and conditions.

- **Network Performance Baseline**  
  Defines the expected network performance, including **latency**, **throughput**, and **packet loss** under normal operating conditions.

### **Purpose:**  
To establish a benchmark for performance that can be used to **detect anomalies** and assess the **impact of changes** on performance.

## üîπ **4Ô∏è‚É£ Compliance Baselines**

Compliance baselines help ensure that systems meet **legal, regulatory, and industry standards** for security and privacy. They are essential for ensuring that organizations adhere to various compliance frameworks.

### **Key Types:**

- **Regulatory Compliance Baseline**  
  Ensures that systems are configured in accordance with regulatory requirements such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **PCI-DSS**, and **SOX**.

- **Industry Compliance Baseline**  
  Addresses standards specific to industries, such as **NIST SP 800-53** for federal agencies or **ISO/IEC 27001** for information security management.

- **Data Protection Compliance Baseline**  
  Focuses on privacy and data protection regulations, ensuring that data handling, storage, and access comply with legal standards (e.g., GDPR).

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure compliance with laws and regulations, thus avoiding penalties and enhancing trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders.

## üîπ **5Ô∏è‚É£ Change Control Baselines**

Change control baselines help manage and control changes to a system, application, or infrastructure. They define the approved configurations and state of a system at a particular point in time.

### **Key Types:**

- **Version Control Baseline**  
  Specifies the **approved versions** of software or hardware components and tracks changes in code or system configuration over time.

- **Configuration Control Baseline**  
  Defines the **approved configuration settings** for systems, including settings, software versions, and network topologies.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that any changes made to the system do not inadvertently introduce errors or vulnerabilities and to keep track of all modifications.

## üîπ **6Ô∏è‚É£ Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Baselines**

These baselines focus on **ensuring that systems and services can recover quickly** after a disaster or unexpected event. They are part of the broader **business continuity planning (BCP)**.

### **Key Types:**

- **Disaster Recovery Baseline**  
  Defines the **recovery time objective (RTO)** and **recovery point objective (RPO)** for systems and applications, along with the procedures and resources needed for recovery.

- **Business Continuity Baseline**  
  Focuses on ensuring that critical business functions remain operational during and after a disaster, outlining the necessary resources, communication strategies, and continuity plans.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that systems can recover swiftly in the event of a disaster and minimize the impact on business operations.

## üîπ **7Ô∏è‚É£ Environmental Baselines**

Environmental baselines refer to the configuration or standards related to the **physical or environmental conditions** necessary for maintaining system stability and performance.

### **Key Types:**
