### **Security Requirement Types**

Security requirements define the rules, standards, and guidelines that a system, application, or product must meet to ensure its security, privacy, and integrity. Below are the **types of security requirements** that are commonly used across various domains.

---

## üîπ **1Ô∏è‚É£ Identification Requirements**

**Identification** refers to the process of recognizing a user or system component in a secure manner. It ensures that the entity involved can be uniquely identified before any access is granted.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Unique IDs:** Every user, system, or device must have a unique identifier.
- **Biometric Identification:** Using biometric traits (fingerprints, face recognition) for user identification.
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** Using cryptographic keys to identify users or devices securely.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that every entity in the system is uniquely identified for proper access control and accountability.

## üîπ **2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication Requirements**

**Authentication** is the process of verifying that an identified user or system is who or what it claims to be.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):** Requires multiple forms of verification (e.g., password, token, fingerprint).
- **Strong Password Policies:** Passwords must be of sufficient complexity and changed regularly.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Uses biological characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, retina scan) for authentication.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that only legitimate users or systems are granted access to the system or data.

---

## üîπ **3Ô∏è‚É£ Authorization Requirements**

**Authorization** defines what actions or resources a user or system is permitted to access once authenticated.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions are granted based on the user‚Äôs role within the organization.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Permissions are granted based on attributes such as location, time, or user behavior.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Defines which users can access which resources.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that authenticated users can only access the resources and perform actions that they are authorized to do.

---

## üîπ **4Ô∏è‚É£ Security Auditing Requirements**

**Security Auditing** ensures that a system logs and monitors activities to detect and respond to security incidents, as well as maintain accountability.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Logging:** All significant security-related events (e.g., login attempts, data access) must be logged.
- **Audit Trails:** Logs must be kept for a defined period and be tamper-resistant.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Systems that monitor for unauthorized or suspicious activities.

### **Purpose:**  
To track and verify system usage, detect security breaches, and ensure compliance with security policies.

---

## üîπ **5Ô∏è‚É£ Confidentiality Requirements**

**Confidentiality** ensures that information is only accessible to those who are authorized to view it, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Data Masking:** Masking sensitive data so unauthorized users cannot view the actual information.
- **Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized users can view confidential data.

### **Purpose:**  
To protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure and ensure privacy.

---

## üîπ **6Ô∏è‚É£ Integrity Requirements**

**Integrity** ensures that information remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered, except by authorized processes.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Checksums and Hashing:** Use cryptographic hash functions to ensure that data has not been altered.
- **Digital Signatures:** Verifies the integrity of data and the identity of the sender.
- **File Integrity Monitoring:** Tools that detect unauthorized changes to files.

### **Purpose:**  
To maintain the accuracy and consistency of data, ensuring it cannot be tampered with or corrupted.

---

## üîπ **7Ô∏è‚É£ Availability Requirements**

**Availability** ensures that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed, minimizing downtime or service interruptions.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Redundancy:** Deploying backup systems and servers to ensure continuous availability.
- **Disaster Recovery Plans:** Establishing recovery processes in case of system failures or disasters.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Defining expected uptime and performance standards for systems.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that systems and services are continuously operational and available to users when needed.

---

## üîπ **8Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Repudiation Requirements**

**Non-repudiation** ensures that actions or transactions cannot be denied or refuted by the parties involved.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Digital Signatures:** Verifying the identity of the sender and ensuring they cannot deny sending a message.
- **Transaction Logs:** Keeping accurate logs of transactions and actions to prove their occurrence.
- **Timestamping:** Ensuring that records have accurate time stamps to validate when an event took place.

### **Purpose:**  
To provide proof of actions and transactions that prevent any party from denying their involvement in the event.

---

## üîπ **9Ô∏è‚É£ Immunity Requirements**

**Immunity** refers to the ability of a system to withstand and operate under hostile conditions, such as attacks or failures.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Resilience to Attacks:** Ensuring systems can operate securely even under attack (e.g., through redundant systems, firewall configurations).
- **Antivirus and Anti-malware:** Protection against malicious software and vulnerabilities.
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Measures to prevent unauthorized access or attacks.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure systems can resist and continue to function in the face of attacks or hostile conditions.

---

## üîπ **üîü Survivability Requirements**

**Survivability** is the system‚Äôs ability to continue operating after a failure or attack, maintaining essential functions under adverse conditions.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Failover Mechanisms:** Switching to backup systems if the primary systems fail.
- **Disaster Recovery Plans:** Procedures to restore system operations after significant failures.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Designing systems that continue to function correctly even if part of the system fails.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that critical systems remain operational even during disasters or attacks, minimizing service disruption.

## üîπ **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Systems Maintenance Security Requirements**

**Systems Maintenance Security** focuses on ensuring that the system remains secure during maintenance activities, such as updates and repairs.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Patch Management:** Regular application of security patches and updates.
- **Secure Remote Access:** Ensuring that remote access for maintenance is secure (e.g., VPN, encrypted sessions).
- **Change Management:** Proper documentation and control of system changes to prevent unauthorized modifications.

### **Purpose:**  
To ensure that system updates and changes are made securely without compromising system integrity.

## üîπ **1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy Requirements**

**Privacy** requirements ensure that personal data is handled in compliance with privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA.

### **Key Aspects:**
- **Data Minimization:** Collect only the necessary amount of personal data and ensure it is stored for only as long as needed.
- **Anonymization and Pseudonymization:** Techniques to protect personal data by anonymizing or pseudonymizing it.
- **Data Subject Rights:** Ensuring individuals can exercise their rights to access, correct, and delete their data.

### **Purpose:**

### **Conclusion**

Security requirements are crucial for ensuring the safety, privacy, and integrity of systems and data. By addressing these various types of security requirements, organizations can build a secure and compliant environment, protecting against a wide range of potential risks and threats.
