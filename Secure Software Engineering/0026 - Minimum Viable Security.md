### **Minimum Viable Security (MVS)**

**Minimum Viable Security (MVS)** refers to the baseline level of security measures that must be implemented to ensure a system, application, or service is sufficiently protected from risks and threats, without introducing unnecessary complexity or overhead. It’s a strategy that focuses on addressing the most critical security needs of a system while maintaining its functionality and agility, especially in fast-paced development environments.

MVS is a concept that balances security with the practicality of delivering a functional product. It’s about identifying the **essential security controls** that reduce the risk of exposure to major vulnerabilities, without overburdening the system or the development process with excessive security measures.

### **Key Aspects of Minimum Viable Security**

1. **Risk Assessment-Based Approach**
   - MVS focuses on **risk-based decision-making** to identify which security measures are absolutely necessary to mitigate the most significant risks. It involves understanding the potential threats and vulnerabilities of the system and prioritizing the implementation of security measures that address the highest-impact risks.

2. **Core Security Principles**
   - MVS ensures that **core security principles** like confidentiality, integrity, and availability are met in the most basic and essential manner. It does not aim for perfection, but for a level of security that reduces the likelihood of significant damage or compromise.
   
3. **Quick to Implement**
   - MVS emphasizes rapid implementation of security controls. It involves applying controls that can be easily and quickly integrated into the system without causing delays in the product’s development or deployment timelines.

4. **Iterative Security Improvements**
   - Like the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** in product development, MVS is not a one-time process. It establishes security controls that are initially set up but are expected to be refined and improved over time as the system matures.

5. **Security without Compromise on Usability**
   - The goal is to strike a balance between **security and usability**. MVS does not enforce overly restrictive or complex security measures that could negatively affect user experience or business agility.

### **Essential Elements of MVS**

Here are the key **security controls** that are typically included in a **Minimum Viable Security** approach:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Basic Authentication:** Ensuring that users can securely log in and access only the areas they are authorized to use.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Limiting access based on user roles to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data or operations.

2. **Data Protection (Confidentiality)**
   - **Data Encryption:** Encrypting sensitive data both at rest (on storage) and in transit (during transmission over networks).
   - **Secure Storage:** Using secure methods to store data, especially sensitive information such as passwords, financial data, or personal information.

3. **Secure Communication**
   - **TLS/SSL Encryption:** Ensuring secure communication channels for web-based applications, protecting data as it travels over the internet.
   - **VPN for Remote Access:** Ensuring secure access to internal resources through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for remote users.

4. **Basic Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Logging Security Events:** Collecting logs for important security events such as failed login attempts, user access to sensitive data, and changes to system configurations.
   - **Basic Intrusion Detection:** Implementing basic intrusion detection systems (IDS) to flag suspicious activities and potential breaches.

5. **Vulnerability Management**
   - **Patch Management:** Ensuring that the system is regularly updated with the latest security patches to minimize vulnerabilities.
   - **Basic Vulnerability Scanning:** Running automated scans to identify and address common vulnerabilities like outdated software or missing patches.

6. **Backup and Recovery**
   - **Basic Backup:** Ensuring that critical system data is backed up regularly and can be restored in case of a disaster or breach.
   - **Disaster Recovery Planning:** Implementing basic recovery procedures to ensure business continuity after a security incident or system failure.

7. **User Education and Awareness**
   - **Security Awareness Training:** Providing basic security training to users to help them understand risks like phishing, password management, and safe internet practices.

### **Why is MVS Important?**

1. **Rapid Development**
   - In environments like **Agile** and **DevOps**, where speed of development and delivery is crucial, MVS ensures that security does not become a bottleneck. It provides just enough protection while enabling the development process to move forward without significant delays.

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Smaller teams or startups may have limited resources and expertise. MVS allows them to prioritize the most important security measures, rather than trying to implement a comprehensive security framework that may be too complex or expensive for their current situation.

3. **Compliance**
   - MVS helps organizations meet basic security requirements and comply with essential regulations or industry standards, even if they are not yet able to implement a full-scale security architecture.

4. **Risk Mitigation**
   - MVS reduces the risk of significant security incidents by implementing foundational security practices that safeguard against common threats like unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.

### **MVS vs. Comprehensive Security Models**

While MVS focuses on the **minimum necessary security measures**, a more **comprehensive security model** would involve a **holistic and in-depth approach** that includes detailed security audits, advanced threat detection systems, deep encryption standards, security by design, and more rigorous security training. A comprehensive security model addresses a wider range of threats and takes into account a system's complexity and long-term security goals.

**MVS** is ideal for initial deployments, early-stage projects, or environments with limited resources, whereas **comprehensive security models** are suited for large-scale, mature systems with more complex requirements.

---

### **Conclusion**

Minimum Viable Security (MVS) is a strategy that ensures a system is secure enough to operate safely and efficiently, balancing security with the need for speed and functionality. By focusing on **core security controls** that address the most significant risks, MVS enables teams to rapidly develop and deploy products while maintaining basic protection from threats. Over time, the system can be further improved with additional security measures as the product evolves and resources become available.
