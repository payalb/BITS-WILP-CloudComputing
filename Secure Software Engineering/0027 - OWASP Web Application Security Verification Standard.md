### **OWASP Web Application Security Verification Standard (WAVS)**

The **OWASP Web Application Security Verification Standard (WAVS)** is a comprehensive, community-driven set of guidelines designed to ensure the security of web applications. The purpose of WAVS is to provide organizations with a framework for evaluating the security of web applications, helping teams identify and mitigate risks throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 

The OWASP WAVS defines a security verification process that includes verification criteria, best practices, and verification tests for assessing the security posture of web applications. It helps ensure that web applications are resilient against various types of cyber threats, from unauthorized access to complex attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.

### **Key Components of OWASP WAVS**

1. **Verification Requirements**
   - The WAVS framework defines the **minimum security requirements** for web applications. These requirements include various security controls, guidelines, and practices that must be implemented, assessed, and verified before releasing or deploying a web application.
   
2. **Risk Assessment**
   - WAVS integrates **risk-based assessments** into the verification process. The framework focuses on assessing potential risks to the web application and verifying that appropriate security controls are in place to mitigate these risks.
   
3. **Verification Levels**
   - The standard is organized into **different verification levels**, each corresponding to a particular stage of web application development or deployment. These levels are designed to help organizations evaluate security progressively and continuously.

### **Core Areas of OWASP WAVS**

The OWASP Web Application Security Verification Standard is divided into several core areas that organizations should focus on when verifying the security of their web applications. These areas include:

---

#### 1. **Information Gathering**

- **Overview:** Collect information about the web application and its environment to identify potential attack vectors and assess the security posture of the application.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - Ensure proper mapping of attack surface areas.
  - Assess network and infrastructure visibility, such as DNS configuration, web server banners, etc.
  - Evaluate the use of public-facing services and third-party integrations.

---

#### 2. **Authentication and Session Management**

- **Overview:** Verify that authentication and session management controls are properly implemented to protect against unauthorized access.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **Strong Authentication:** Use of multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure password policies, and proper login mechanisms.
  - **Session Management:** Proper session expiration, secure cookies, and session hijacking protections.
  - **Account Lockout Mechanisms:** Account lockouts after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

---

#### 3. **Access Control**

- **Overview:** Verify that the application enforces proper access control measures to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data or resources.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access is granted based on the user's role.
  - **Least Privilege:** Ensuring that users and services have only the minimum permissions necessary.
  - **Access Control Tests:** Checking for authorization flaws that could lead to unauthorized access.

---

#### 4. **Input Validation and Data Handling**

- **Overview:** Verify that the application properly validates and sanitizes inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection-based attacks.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **Input Sanitization:** Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated.
  - **Output Encoding:** Prevent XSS and data leakage through output encoding and escaping.
  - **Validation against Known Threats:** Ensure the system is protected against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XML injection, etc.

---

#### 5. **Error Handling and Logging**

- **Overview:** Ensure the application handles errors securely and logs security-relevant events for auditing purposes.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **Proper Error Handling:** Ensure that the system does not expose sensitive information in error messages.
  - **Logging Mechanisms:** Ensure that logs capture security-relevant events, including failed login attempts, privilege escalations, and changes to user permissions.
  - **Audit Trails:** Ensure that logs are protected against tampering and are stored for the appropriate amount of time.

---

#### 6. **Cryptography**

- **Overview:** Verify the use of strong cryptography to protect sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **Secure Data Storage:** Ensure sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card information, are properly encrypted at rest.
  - **Secure Data Transmission:** Ensure that data transmitted over networks is encrypted using secure protocols like TLS/SSL.
  - **Cryptographic Key Management:** Ensure that cryptographic keys are securely stored and rotated regularly.

---

#### 7. **Security Configuration**

- **Overview:** Verify that security configurations for web servers, databases, and other components are set up correctly and follow best practices.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **Secure Server Configuration:** Ensure that unnecessary services and ports are closed, and security patches are applied to the server.
  - **Database Security:** Ensure databases are securely configured, with appropriate access controls and encryption.
  - **Security Headers:** Ensure the application uses security-related HTTP headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options.

---

#### 8. **Business Logic Security**

- **Overview:** Assess the applicationâ€™s logic for vulnerabilities that could lead to unintended behavior or business logic bypass.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **Business Process Flow:** Ensure that the application logic follows secure business processes and cannot be bypassed.
  - **Input Integrity:** Ensure that business rules are validated server-side, not just client-side.
  - **Transaction Management:** Ensure that transactions are properly controlled, and sensitive actions require additional verification.

---

#### 9. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

- **Overview:** Verify that the application is protected against XSS and CSRF attacks, which could lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
  
- **Verification Criteria:**
  - **XSS Protection:** Ensure that user input is properly encoded and filtered to prevent malicious scripts from executing.
  - **CSRF Protection:** Ensure that anti-CSRF tokens are used for state-changing requests to prevent attackers from tricking users into performing unintended actions.

---

### **Verification Levels in OWASP WAVS**

WAVS defines multiple **verification levels** that correspond to different stages of the SDLC. Each level builds upon the previous one and includes additional checks to assess the security posture of the application:

1. **Level 1: Basic Security Requirements**
   - Minimum security practices that every application should follow to mitigate the most common and dangerous threats.
   
2. **Level 2: Advanced Security Testing**
   - More detailed testing covering advanced security measures, threat modeling, and sophisticated attack vectors.
   
3. **Level 3: Comprehensive Security Validation**
   - A complete and in-depth evaluation of security across all layers of the application, including source code reviews, penetration testing, and security audits.

### **Benefits of OWASP WAVS**

- **Comprehensive Framework:** Provides a thorough, structured approach to web application security verification.
- **Standardization:** Helps organizations standardize security verification processes across different projects and teams.
- **Risk Mitigation:** By following the WAVS, organizations can identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before they become exploitable.
- **Security Awareness:** WAVS promotes awareness of security issues among development and security teams, facilitating better collaboration.

### **Conclusion**

The **OWASP Web Application Security Verification Standard (WAVS)** is a vital tool for securing web applications. It helps organizations follow a structured and systematic process to identify, mitigate, and verify security vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle. By adhering to this standard, organizations can improve their web application security posture and better protect their systems from cyber threats.
