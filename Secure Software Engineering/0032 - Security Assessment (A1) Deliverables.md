     - Metrics on the effectiveness of the tests (e.g., percentage of code tested, coverage)

---

### **7. Penetration Testing Report**
   - **Purpose:** A **penetration testing report** captures the results of simulating real-world cyberattacks to identify weaknesses in the system's defenses.
   - **Contents:**
     - Overview of penetration testing methodology and scope (e.g., internal testing, external testing, social engineering)
     - Identified vulnerabilities (e.g., broken authentication, privilege escalation)
     - Exploits performed during testing and outcomes
     - Risk analysis and severity ratings for each vulnerability
     - Recommendations for mitigation (e.g., patching, reconfiguring systems, applying least privilege principles)

---

### **8. Vulnerability Management Plan**
   - **Purpose:** This document outlines the processes and procedures for tracking, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities identified during security assessments.
   - **Contents:**
     - A detailed list of all vulnerabilities identified during security assessments
     - Severity rankings for each vulnerability (e.g., critical, high, medium, low)
     - Recommended remediation steps for each vulnerability
     - Timelines for resolving vulnerabilities based on severity
