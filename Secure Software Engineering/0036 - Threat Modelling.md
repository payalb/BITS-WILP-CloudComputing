### **Threat Modeling**  

**Threat modeling** is a structured process for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential security threats in a system. It helps organizations proactively detect vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

## **Steps in Threat Modeling**  

1. **Identify Assets**  
   - Determine what needs protection (e.g., data, APIs, systems, credentials).  
   - Example: **Customer personal data in an e-commerce application.**  

2. **Define the Attack Surface**  
   - Identify all entry points where an attacker could exploit the system.  
   - Example: **APIs, web forms, network ports, third-party integrations.**  

3. **Identify Threats**  
   - Use structured methodologies like **STRIDE** or **DREAD** to categorize threats.  
   - Example: **A threat actor may attempt SQL Injection on the login page.**  

4. **Prioritize Threats**  
   - Assess the impact and likelihood of each threat.  
   - Example: **High-impact threats like credential theft get top priority.**  

5. **Implement Security Controls**  
   - Mitigate risks by applying security best practices.  
   - Example: **Use Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent SQL Injection.**  

6. **Validate and Iterate**  
   - Regularly test security measures with penetration testing.  
   - Update the threat model as new threats emerge.

## **Threat Modeling Methodologies**  

### **1. STRIDE (Microsoft’s Model)**  
Categorizes threats into six types:  
- **S**poofing → Fake identity (e.g., bypassing authentication).  
- **T**ampering → Modifying data (e.g., altering transaction amounts).  
- **R**epudiation → Denying an action (e.g., deleting logs).  
- **I**nformation Disclosure → Data leaks (e.g., unencrypted API responses).  
- **D**enial of Service (DoS) → Crashing a system (e.g., DDoS attack).  
- **E**levation of Privilege → Gaining unauthorized access (e.g., exploiting a misconfigured admin account).  

### **2. DREAD (Risk-Based Model)**  
Ranks threats based on:  
- **D**amage potential → How severe is the impact?  
- **R**eproducibility → How easily can it be exploited?  
- **E**xploitability → How simple is the attack?  
- **A**ffected users → How many users will be impacted?  
- **D**iscoverability → How easy is it to find the vulnerability?  

### **3. PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**  
- A risk-based, business-driven methodology that includes attacker simulation.  

### **4. Attack Trees**  
- A visual representation of attack paths to analyze system weaknesses.

## **Best Practices for Threat Modeling**  

✅ **Start early** – Conduct threat modeling in the design phase.  
✅ **Use automation** – Tools like **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool** can help.  
✅ **Adopt Zero Trust** – Never assume internal components are safe.  
✅ **Review regularly** – Update threat models as new features are added.  
✅ **Involve stakeholders** – Developers, security teams, and business owners should collaborate.  

Threat modeling helps organizations **anticipate, prioritize, and mitigate** security risks before they become serious threats.
