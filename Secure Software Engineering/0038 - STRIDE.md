### **STRIDE Threat Model**  

**STRIDE** is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft to identify and categorize security threats in a system. It helps security teams anticipate potential risks and design defenses early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## **STRIDE Categories and Examples**  

| **Threat**             | **Description**                                      | **Example Attack** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **S**poofing          | Impersonating another user or system                 | Stolen passwords allow unauthorized access |
| **T**ampering         | Modifying data to alter its integrity                | An attacker modifies financial transactions |
| **R**epudiation       | Denying performing an action without proof           | A user deletes logs to cover malicious actions |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Unauthorized access to sensitive data         | An attacker intercepts unencrypted API responses |
| **D**enial of Service (DoS) | Disrupting availability of a system        | A DDoS attack crashes an online service |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized higher-level access | A user exploits a vulnerability to become an admin |

## **How STRIDE is Used in Threat Modeling**  

1. **Identify System Components**  
   - Use **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** to map out entities, processes, data stores, and flows.  
   
2. **Apply STRIDE to Each Component**  
   - Analyze each **data flow, process, and storage** for potential threats.  

3. **Assess the Impact and Likelihood**  
   - Prioritize high-risk threats based on their impact on security.  

4. **Mitigate Risks**  
   - Implement security controls (e.g., encryption, authentication, logging).

## **STRIDE Mitigation Strategies**  

| **Threat**             | **Mitigation Techniques** |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Spoofing**          | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), digital certificates |
| **Tampering**         | Cryptographic integrity checks (e.g., hashing, digital signatures) |
| **Repudiation**       | Secure logging and audit trails |
| **Information Disclosure** | Encryption, role-based access control (RBAC) |
| **Denial of Service** | Rate limiting, DDoS protection, load balancing |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Least privilege access control, patch management |

## **Example: STRIDE Applied to a Web Application**  

### Scenario: **User Login System**
- **Spoofing:** Attackers attempt credential stuffing → **Mitigation:** MFA, CAPTCHA  
- **Tampering:** Altering session cookies → **Mitigation:** Secure cookie attributes  
- **Repudiation:** Users deny login attempts → **Mitigation:** Logging and monitoring  
- **Information Disclosure:** Passwords exposed in logs → **Mitigation:** Hashing and encryption  
- **Denial of Service:** Brute force login attempts → **Mitigation:** Account lockout policy  
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Regular user gaining admin rights → **Mitigation:** Role-based access control (RBAC)  

By integrating **STRIDE analysis** into **security design**, organizations can **proactively address security vulnerabilities** and build resilient systems.
