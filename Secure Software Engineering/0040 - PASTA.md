### **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**  

**PASTA** is a **risk-centric** threat modeling framework that helps organizations analyze and mitigate security threats by simulating real-world attacks. It is designed to align **business objectives** with **technical security risks**, making it ideal for **enterprise security assessments**.  

---

## **Why Use PASTA?**  
✅ Focuses on **business impact**, not just technical threats.  
✅ Simulates **real-world attack scenarios** to improve defense strategies.  
✅ Provides a **structured approach** for prioritizing security measures.  
✅ Helps integrate **security into the SDLC** effectively.

## **PASTA’s 7-Stage Process**  

| **Stage**  | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **1. Define Business Objectives** | Identify the system’s purpose, security goals, and compliance needs. |
| **2. Define the Technical Scope** | Map out the system architecture, including assets, components, and dependencies. |
| **3. Application Decomposition** | Break down the application into **data flows, processes, and interactions**. |
| **4. Threat Analysis** | Identify **potential security threats** using STRIDE, ATT&CK, and threat intelligence. |
| **5. Vulnerability Analysis** | Find **weaknesses** using penetration testing, security scanning, and code review. |
| **6. Attack Simulation** | Simulate **real-world attack scenarios** to assess exploitability. |
| **7. Risk and Impact Analysis** | Prioritize threats based on **business impact** and define mitigation strategies. |

## **How PASTA Works in Threat Modeling**  

### **Example: Threat Modeling an Online Banking System**  

| **Stage** | **Example for Online Banking** |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **1. Define Business Objectives** | Protect customer financial data and ensure compliance with PCI DSS. |
| **2. Define the Technical Scope** | Identify APIs, databases, authentication systems, and third-party integrations. |
| **3. Application Decomposition** | Map user authentication, transaction processing, and data storage flows. |
| **4. Threat Analysis** | Use STRIDE to identify **spoofing (fake users), tampering (transaction modification), and DoS (service downtime)** threats. |
| **5. Vulnerability Analysis** | Scan for **SQL injection, insecure APIs, weak authentication** mechanisms. |
| **6. Attack Simulation** | Perform penetration testing to simulate **credential stuffing and API abuse** attacks. |
| **7. Risk and Impact Analysis** | Rank threats based on **DREAD scoring** and apply fixes (e.g., **MFA, API rate limiting, WAF**). |

## **PASTA vs. Other Threat Models**  

| **Model** | **Focus** | **Best Used For** |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **STRIDE** | Threat classification | Identifying security threats |
| **DREAD** | Risk assessment | Prioritizing security fixes |
| **PASTA** | Business-driven risk modeling | Simulating real-world attacks & risk mitigation |

---

## **Best Practices for PASTA**  

✅ **Integrate with DevSecOps** to apply security in early SDLC stages.  
✅ **Use automation tools** for vulnerability scanning and attack simulation.  
✅ **Involve security teams, developers, and business stakeholders**.  
✅ **Regularly update threat models** as new risks emerge.  

PASTA provides a **holistic, attack-driven approach** to **proactively identify, assess, and mitigate security risks**, making it one of the most **comprehensive threat modeling frameworks**.
