### ✅ **Trustworthiness Principles in Cybersecurity**

Trustworthiness in cybersecurity means that **systems, applications, and devices can be relied upon to function correctly and securely**, even when under attack or facing unexpected conditions. These principles help ensure the **confidence** of users, developers, and stakeholders.

## 🛡️ **Key Principles of Trustworthiness**

### 1. **Security**
- Protects systems from unauthorized access and tampering.
- Includes **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** (CIA Triad).

### 2. **Reliability**
- The system **performs consistently** and correctly under expected conditions.
- Essential for maintaining uptime and service quality.

### 3. **Resilience**
- The system can **recover from failures or attacks** and continue operating.
- Involves **redundancy, backups, and graceful degradation**.

### 4. **Safety**
- Ensures that the system **does not cause harm** to people, assets, or the environment.
- Critical in systems like **healthcare, transportation, and industrial control**.

### 5. **Privacy**
- Protects **personal and sensitive data** from misuse or exposure.
- Enforces **data minimization, purpose limitation, and consent management**.
