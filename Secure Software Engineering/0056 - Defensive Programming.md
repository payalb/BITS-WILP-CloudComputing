Defensive programming is a technique used by developers to ensure that their code behaves in a predictable and reliable way, even when unexpected conditions occur. The goal is to anticipate and handle potential errors, invalid inputs, or unpredictable environments before they cause issues. By doing so, the program becomes more robust, secure, and less likely to crash or produce incorrect results.

Some key principles of defensive programming include:

1. **Input validation**: Ensuring that all inputs (user-provided or from other systems) are checked for validity before being processed. This helps prevent unexpected or malicious data from affecting the program's behavior.
   - Example: Checking if a user has entered a valid number or ensuring a file path exists before attempting to read from it.

2. **Error handling**: Gracefully handling errors and exceptions instead of letting the program crash. This includes catching exceptions, logging errors, and providing meaningful error messages to users.
   - Example: Using `try` and `catch` blocks to handle unexpected errors in a program.

3. **Assumptions and constraints**: Making assumptions explicit in your code, and ensuring those assumptions hold true during runtime. This includes setting constraints on data, such as maximum values or specific formats.
   - Example: If a function assumes an integer will always be positive, the code should check for that and handle any violations appropriately.

4. **Fail-safes and backups**: Adding mechanisms to recover from unexpected situations. This can include using fallback values, creating backups of important data, or using default behaviors when an operation fails.
   - Example: If a network connection fails, the program may attempt to reconnect a few times before notifying the user of an issue.

5. **Logging and monitoring**: Keeping detailed logs of system behavior, especially errors and exceptions. This makes it easier to diagnose issues and improve the system over time.
   - Example: Logging all failed login attempts or logging when certain critical operations complete.

6. **Boundary testing**: Testing inputs and edge cases, especially those that may seem unlikely but could cause failures or vulnerabilities.
   - Example: Checking how a program behaves when processing an empty list or extremely large numbers.

In short, defensive programming aims to create programs that are resilient to errors and adversities, making them safer and more reliable in real-world use cases.
