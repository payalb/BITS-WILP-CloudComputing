### SAST – Source, Sink, Taint, Vulnerability, Control Flow Graph, Path Traversal, Apply Checking
---

### 1. **Source**

* A *source* is any point in the code where untrusted input enters the system.
* Examples:

  * User input from forms (`request.GET`, `input()`)
  * Network data, file input, cookies, APIs

---

### 2. **Sink**

* A *sink* is a code location where untrusted data can cause harm if it’s not properly validated or sanitized.
* Examples:

  * SQL queries (`cursor.execute(...)`)
  * HTML rendering (`innerHTML = ...`)
  * System commands (`os.system(...)`)

---

### 3. **Taint**

* *Taint* refers to the tracking of untrusted data (from a source) as it flows through the application.
* If data from a source reaches a sink **without proper sanitization**, it is considered **tainted** and may introduce a vulnerability.

---

### 4. **Vulnerability**

* A *vulnerability* arises when tainted data reaches a sensitive sink and causes unintended behavior.
* Examples:

  * Tainted input reaches SQL query → **SQL Injection**
  * Tainted input in HTML rendering → **XSS**
  * Tainted input in file operations → **Path Traversal**

---

### 5. **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**

* A **Control Flow Graph** represents all possible execution paths through a program.
* **Nodes**: Statements or basic blocks
* **Edges**: Transitions (e.g., `if`, `while`, `for`)
* CFGs help in:

  * Analyzing taint propagation
  * Identifying unreachable code
  * Performing flow-sensitive vulnerability detection

---

### 6. **Path Traversal**

* A vulnerability where an attacker manipulates file paths to access restricted files or directories.
* Example input: `../../../etc/passwd`
* Detected in SAST by:

  * Tracking tainted input into file handling APIs (`open()`, `File()`, `readFile()`)

---

### 7. **Apply Checking (Semantic Checking)**

* Refers to applying security rules/checks across the data flow and control flow paths to identify violations.
* Examples:

  * Ensuring data from `source` is sanitized before reaching `sink`
  * Checking correct use of cryptographic APIs (e.g., using secure algorithms, key sizes)
* Often implemented using:

  * Taint analysis
  * Pattern matching
  * Symbolic execution

| Concept        | Role in SAST                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Source         | Entry point of untrusted input                      |
| Sink           | Critical operation point where input may cause harm |
| Taint          | Untrusted data flow that is tracked                 |
| Vulnerability  | Unsafe condition when tainted data reaches a sink   |
| CFG            | Visual model to analyze code execution paths        |
| Path Traversal | Vulnerability type based on malicious file paths    |
| Apply Checking | Rule-based semantic validation across flows         |

These core concepts form the foundation of static code analysis and are essential for identifying security flaws early in the development lifecycle.
