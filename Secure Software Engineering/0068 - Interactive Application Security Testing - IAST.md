### Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)

**Definition:**
Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) is a hybrid security testing approach that combines aspects of both **SAST** and **DAST**. It analyzes an application from **within** while it is running, providing deep visibility into code execution, data flow, and runtime behavior.

---

### Key Characteristics

* **Gray-box testing**: Requires partial knowledge of the application (e.g., access to runtime environment and code context)
* Uses **instrumentation agents** integrated into the application server or runtime
* Works during **manual or automated functional testing** (e.g., during QA testing or CI pipeline runs)
* Provides **real-time vulnerability detection** with detailed data flow insights

---

### Objectives

* Detect runtime vulnerabilities with code-level context
* Provide accurate, actionable feedback to developers
* Reduce false positives compared to SAST/DAST alone
* Support security testing **continuously** in CI/CD environments

---

### How IAST Works

1. **Instrumentation Agent Integration**

   * An agent is embedded in the application (at runtime or during deployment)

2. **Application Execution**

   * The app is exercised through normal usage, automated tests, or manual QA

3. **Data Monitoring**

   * The agent observes HTTP requests, code execution paths, data flows, and interactions with sinks (e.g., file system, DB)

4. **Vulnerability Detection**

   * When tainted data flows into unsafe sinks without sanitization, vulnerabilities are reported with full tracebacks and code references

---

### Vulnerabilities Detected

* SQL Injection
* Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
* Path Traversal
* Insecure deserialization
* Security misconfigurations
* Insecure use of cryptography
* Unsafe file access and input handling

---

### Advantages

* Combines depth of **SAST** and realism of **DAST**
* Real-time, contextual feedback with exact code references
* Low false positives
* Works in real usage scenarios (e.g., QA, integration testing)
* Minimal disruption to dev workflow

---

### Limitations

* Requires integration with the runtime or app server
* Needs test traffic (automated tests or manual usage) to trigger code paths
* Limited support for all frameworks or languages
* May not scale well to large apps without performance tuning

---

### Common IAST Tools

* Contrast Security
* Seeker by Synopsys
* Hdiv Security
* Fortify IAST
* AppScan IAST (IBM)

### IAST vs SAST vs DAST â€“ Comparison Table

| Feature               | SAST         | DAST              | IAST                     |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Code Access           | Yes          | No                | Partial (instrumented)   |
| Runs on Live App      | No           | Yes               | Yes                      |
| Test Phase            | Dev (static) | Test/QA (runtime) | QA/Integration (runtime) |
| False Positives       | High         | Medium            | Low                      |
| Language Independence | No           | Yes               | Limited                  |
| Contextual Accuracy   | Low          | Medium            | High                     |

---

### Best Practices

* Integrate IAST into test environments (CI/CD pipelines or QA servers)
* Ensure test cases and user flows are comprehensive
* Use alongside SAST and DAST for full security coverage
* Regularly update agent and rules to detect new threats

---

### Conclusion

IAST provides a **balanced and highly accurate** approach to application security testing. By combining **code-level visibility** with **runtime analysis**, it addresses many limitations of SAST and DAST, making it a valuable component of modern Secure Software Engineering practices.
