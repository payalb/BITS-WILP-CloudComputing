### Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

---

### **Definition:**

The **Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)** is a **peer-reviewed, open standard** for performing high-quality, structured security tests. It focuses on providing **measurable, repeatable**, and **scientifically grounded** methods for assessing the security of **operations, systems, and people**.

---

### **Published By:**

ISECOM (Institute for Security and Open Methodologies)

---

### **Key Objectives:**

* Establish a **universal security testing framework**
* Ensure **consistency** and **objectivity** in testing
* Define **trust levels** and **attack surfaces**
* Support **risk analysis** and **decision-making** based on facts

---

### **Core Concepts:**

#### 1. **Five Channels of Attack**

Security is tested across these interaction vectors:

* **Human** – Social engineering, phishing
* **Physical** – Locks, badges, physical access
* **Wireless** – Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RF communication
* **Telecommunications** – Phone lines, modems, VoIP
* **Data Networks** – Internet, intranet, LAN/WAN

#### 2. **Operational Security Metrics:**

OSSTMM uses the **RAV model**:

* **R** – *Risk* (actual exposure)
* **A** – *Attack* (possible avenues)
* **V** – *Vulnerability* (weaknesses)

#### 3. **Rules of Engagement (RoE):**

Defined procedures to:

* Avoid legal or ethical violations
* Clarify scope, depth, and limitations
* Set tester behavior and target expectations

#### 4. **Trust Analysis:**

OSSTMM emphasizes that **trust is a vulnerability**. Systems are evaluated for **trust relationships** and **trust boundaries**.

#### 5. **Security Metrics:**

Uses **Scientific Methodology** to:

* Measure **Operational Security (OpSec)**
* Produce **quantitative results** based on actual controls
* Avoid speculation; results must be **verifiable**

### **OSSTMM Testing Modules:**

| Module               | Focus Area                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Information Security | Data handling, access controls         |
| Internet Technology  | IP services, firewalls, web apps       |
| Communications       | Telephony, VoIP, mobile systems        |
| Wireless             | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID                 |
| Physical Security    | Buildings, surveillance, entry control |
| Human Security       | Social engineering, behavior testing   |

---

### **Differences from Other Methodologies:**

| Feature             | OSSTMM                          | OWASP / NIST / ISO          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Scope               | Broad (technical + operational) | Mostly technical/IT-focused |
| Metrics             | Quantitative, scientific        | Often qualitative           |
| Channels            | All (Human, Physical, Digital)  | Primarily digital           |
| Trust Consideration | Core concept                    | Often implicit or ignored   |
| Open Standard       | Yes                             | Varies                      |

---

### **Advantages of OSSTMM:**

* Comprehensive coverage of **all attack surfaces**
* Based on **scientific rigor**, not checklists
* Can be used for **compliance, audits, penetration tests**
* Produces measurable and repeatable results

---

### **Limitations:**

* May be too complex or broad for small projects
* Requires trained professionals for accurate implementation
* Not as commonly adopted as other frameworks (e.g., OWASP)

---

### **Conclusion:**

OSSTMM is a **comprehensive, methodology-driven approach** to security testing. It is especially useful in **enterprise and operational security audits** where **quantitative metrics**, **trust evaluation**, and **realistic threat modeling** are required. For secure software engineering, it provides a **framework to validate security across both code and operational layers**.
