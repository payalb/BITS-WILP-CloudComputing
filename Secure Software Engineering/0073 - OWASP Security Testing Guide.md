### OWASP Security Testing Guide (STG)

---

### **Definition:**

The **OWASP Security Testing Guide (STG)** is a comprehensive, community-driven resource that provides best practices, methodologies, and checklists for testing the security of web applications and APIs.

---

### **Purpose:**

* Help security testers systematically identify and exploit vulnerabilities
* Provide practical techniques for both manual and automated testing
* Support developers and security teams in verifying application security controls

---

### **Key Components of OWASP STG:**

1. **Testing Methodology**
   A structured approach broken into phases:

   * **Information Gathering**: Collect data about the application, technologies, and infrastructure
   * **Configuration and Deployment Management Testing**: Check for insecure configurations
   * **Identity Management Testing**: Assess authentication and user management
   * **Authentication Testing**: Validate password policies, MFA, credential handling
   * **Authorization Testing**: Test access controls and privilege escalation
   * **Session Management Testing**: Analyze session tokens, fixation, and expiration
   * **Input Validation Testing**: Look for injection flaws and data manipulation
   * **Error Handling**: Check for information leakage through error messages
   * **Cryptography Testing**: Verify use of cryptographic functions and protocols
   * **Business Logic Testing**: Detect flaws in application workflows
   * **Client-Side Testing**: Assess security controls on the client side (e.g., DOM XSS)
   * **API Testing**: Test RESTful or SOAP API security

2. **Vulnerability Categories:**
   The guide aligns closely with OWASP Top 10 but covers a wider range of issues:

   * Injection
   * Broken Authentication
   * Sensitive Data Exposure
   * XML External Entities (XXE)
   * Broken Access Control
   * Security Misconfiguration
   * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   * Insecure Deserialization
   * Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
   * Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

3. **Testing Techniques:**

   * Manual testing with tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)
   * Automated scanning combined with manual verification
   * Source code review pointers

4. **Checklists and Test Cases:**
   Detailed checklists help testers cover specific scenarios such as:

   * Validating input sanitization
   * Testing multi-factor authentication
   * Examining secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   * Confirming proper error handling and logging

---

### **Advantages:**

* Open source and regularly updated
* Extensive, practical guidance from the community
* Covers both technical and business logic aspects
* Widely accepted as a standard in web application security testing

---

### **Limitations:**

* Primarily focused on web applications (less on mobile/native apps)
* Requires security expertise to apply effectively
* Can be extensive and time-consuming for complete coverage

---

### **Relation to Secure Software Engineering:**

* Integrates well with development lifecycle as part of **security testing phases**
* Helps bridge the gap between security requirements and validation
* Supports continuous security assurance via manual and automated tests
* Enables developers and testers to understand common vulnerabilities and their testing methods

---

### **Summary:**

The **OWASP Security Testing Guide** is a critical resource for mastering application security testing. It combines methodology, technical detail, and practical examples to empower security professionals in detecting vulnerabilities early and thoroughly. For a masterâ€™s level understanding in Secure Software Engineering, OWASP STG is fundamental for designing and executing effective security tests.
