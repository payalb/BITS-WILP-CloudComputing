### Building Secure Images for Cloud Products

---

### **Definition:**

Building secure images involves **creating hardened, minimal, and verifiable software images** (e.g., VM images, container images) used to deploy cloud applications. These images must be free from vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and unnecessary software.

---

### **Why It's Critical in Secure Software Engineering:**

Cloud workloads often rely on **pre-built images** that run in dynamic, scalable environments. An insecure image can:

* Expose secrets or credentials
* Contain outdated packages with known CVEs
* Enable privilege escalation or lateral movement
* Be replicated across thousands of instances

---

### **Principles of Building Secure Images:**

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**

   * Smaller attack surface (e.g., `distroless`, `alpine`)
   * Avoid full OS images unless necessary

2. **Install Only Required Software**

   * Avoid unnecessary tools like compilers or shells
   * Reduces potential exploit vectors

3. **Use Verified Sources**

   * Pull packages and libraries from trusted repositories
   * Verify checksums or signatures

4. **Patch and Update Regularly**

   * Apply latest security patches before freezing the image
   * Monitor for vulnerabilities in base and application layers

5. **Scan for Vulnerabilities**

   * Use tools like **Trivy**, **Grype**, **Clair**, or **Snyk**
   * Scan both during build time and after deployment

6. **Do Not Embed Secrets**

   * Never hardcode credentials, API keys, or tokens in images
   * Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

7. **Use Multi-Stage Builds** (for containers)

   * Separate build dependencies from runtime
   * Final image contains only the necessary binaries

8. **Set Secure Permissions**

   * Run processes as **non-root** where possible
   * Set file permissions and ownership explicitly

9. **Implement Immutable Infrastructure**

   * Treat images as immutable artifacts
   * Replace, not patch, running instances

10. **Sign and Verify Images**

* Use **Sigstore**, **cosign**, or **Docker Content Trust**
* Enables image integrity and provenance validation

### **Container Image Example – Best Practices:**

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

FROM gcr.io/distroless/static
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /
USER nonroot:nonroot
ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
```

* Uses multi-stage build
* Final image has no shell or package manager
* Runs as non-root

### **Security Hardening Checklist:**

| Task                           | Status |
| ------------------------------ | ------ |
| Base image from trusted source | ✅      |
| Unused packages removed        | ✅      |
| Secrets removed                | ✅      |
| Vulnerability scan passed      | ✅      |
| Non-root user configured       | ✅      |
| Image signed and verified      | ✅      |

---

### **Integration with CI/CD:**

* Automate image scanning (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
* Enforce image policies using **OPA Gatekeeper**, **Kyverno**, or **Admission Controllers**
* Monitor deployed images for drift or tampering

---

### **Relevant Tools:**

| Purpose            | Tools                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Image scanning     | Trivy, Clair, Grype, Snyk    |
| Image signing      | Cosign, Docker Content Trust |
| Build automation   | Docker, Buildah, Kaniko      |
| Policy enforcement | Kyverno, Gatekeeper, Falco   |

---

### **Conclusion:**

Building secure images is a foundational practice in deploying safe cloud applications. In Secure Software Engineering, this means **reducing attack surface, eliminating vulnerabilities**, and **ensuring traceability** throughout the image lifecycle. Secure images lead to more resilient, maintainable, and compliant cloud systems.
