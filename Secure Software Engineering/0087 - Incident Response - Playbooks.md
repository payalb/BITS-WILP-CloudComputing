### Incident Response – Playbooks

---

### **Definition:**

An **Incident Response Playbook** is a **structured, predefined set of steps** and actions that a security team follows when a specific type of security incident occurs. Playbooks help standardize response, reduce reaction time, and minimize damage.

---

### **Purpose of Playbooks:**

* Ensure **consistency** in handling incidents
* Enable **quick and informed decision-making**
* Define roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths
* Improve **coordination across teams**
* Ensure **compliance** with internal policies and external regulations

### **Structure of an Incident Response Playbook:**

| Section                  | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident Type**        | Category of the incident (e.g., malware, phishing, data breach)           |
| **Detection Sources**    | Logs, alerts, monitoring tools, threat intelligence                       |
| **Initial Triage**       | Assess severity, affected systems, and immediate actions                  |
| **Containment Steps**    | Stop the spread or impact of the attack                                   |
| **Eradication Steps**    | Remove threat actors, malware, or vulnerabilities                         |
| **Recovery Steps**       | Restore systems and services to normal operation                          |
| **Post-Incident Review** | Lessons learned, gaps identified, and process improvement                 |
| **Communication Plan**   | Internal and external notifications, including legal/compliance reporting |
| **Tools Required**       | IR tools (SIEM, EDR, forensic software, etc.)                             |
| **Roles and Contacts**   | Key personnel involved in the response                                    |

### **Common Incident Types with Example Playbooks:**

#### **1. Malware Infection**

* Detect via EDR or antivirus alert
* Isolate affected endpoint
* Collect malware samples for analysis
* Wipe and rebuild if needed
* Update malware signatures and rules

#### **2. Phishing Attack**

* Employee reports suspicious email
* Block sender/domain
* Remove similar emails from other inboxes
* Notify affected users and reset passwords if needed
* Conduct awareness training

#### **3. Web Application Exploitation**

* WAF/IDS alert on suspicious request pattern
* Analyze logs to identify exploitation
* Contain by disabling vulnerable service or feature
* Patch code or apply virtual patch
* Retest and deploy fix

#### **4. Data Breach**

* Identify breached data and vector
* Notify legal and compliance teams
* Engage forensic experts
* Inform affected customers (if required)
* Report to regulatory bodies (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

#### **5. Insider Threat**

* Detect via behavior monitoring tools
* Monitor and log account activities
* Suspend access and begin investigation
* Interview staff and review HR actions
* Review access controls and policies

### **Best Practices for Using Playbooks:**

* Keep them **simple, clear, and actionable**
* Use **automated steps** when possible (e.g., via SOAR tools)
* Regularly **review and update** based on new threats
* Integrate playbooks with **incident response platforms**
* Conduct **tabletop exercises** and **mock drills**

---

### **Tools for Playbook Automation:**

* **SOAR platforms** (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):
  – Examples: Splunk SOAR, Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR, IBM Resilient
* **SIEM systems**: Correlate events and trigger playbooks
* **Ticketing systems**: Link response tasks to incidents (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)

---

### **Conclusion:**

Incident response playbooks are an essential component of **proactive and efficient security operations**. In Secure Software Engineering, they provide a **repeatable framework** to manage and contain security incidents while minimizing risk and ensuring business continuity.
