### Incident Response Methodology

---

### **Definition:**

Incident Response Methodology is a **structured, step-by-step approach** for identifying, managing, and mitigating security incidents in order to minimize damage and ensure a swift return to normal operations.

---

### **Goals:**

* Detect and contain security incidents quickly
* Minimize the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
* Preserve evidence for legal or forensic analysis
* Learn from incidents to prevent recurrence

---

### **Standard Incident Response Phases:**

| Phase                       | Description                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Preparation**          | Build capabilities, teams, tools, and processes before incidents occur       |
| **2. Detection & Analysis** | Identify and investigate potential incidents using logs, alerts, reports     |
| **3. Containment**          | Prevent the incident from spreading or causing further damage                |
| **4. Eradication**          | Remove the root cause (e.g., malware, vulnerabilities, compromised accounts) |
| **5. Recovery**             | Restore systems and verify full functionality                                |
| **6. Lessons Learned**      | Conduct post-incident review to improve defenses and processes               |

### **1. Preparation:**

* Establish an **Incident Response Team (IRT)** or **CSIRT**
* Develop policies, playbooks, and communication plans
* Train staff on security awareness and incident handling
* Deploy and configure necessary tools: SIEM, EDR, firewalls, logging systems

---

### **2. Detection & Analysis:**

* Detect incidents using:

  * Logs, SIEM alerts
  * IDS/IPS, antivirus, user reports
  * Threat intelligence feeds
* Analyze:

  * Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
  * Attack scope, affected assets
  * Root cause and attacker behavior

---

### **3. Containment:**

* Short-term (immediate): isolate affected systems (e.g., network segmentation)
* Long-term: apply temporary mitigations, disable compromised accounts
* Balance **containment speed** with **forensic needs** (avoid losing evidence)

---

### **4. Eradication:**

* Remove malware or unauthorized software
* Revoke compromised credentials
* Patch exploited vulnerabilities
* Clean up backdoors or persistence mechanisms

---

### **5. Recovery:**

* Restore from backups or rebuild affected systems
* Monitor for signs of reinfection or persistence
* Validate system integrity and functionality
* Resume normal operations gradually

---

### **6. Lessons Learned (Post-Incident Activity):**

* Hold a **retrospective or postmortem**
* Document timeline, findings, response effectiveness
* Update:

  * Detection rules
  * Incident response plans
  * Playbooks and training
* Report metrics to leadership (MTTD, MTTR, impact)

---

### **Supporting Standards and Frameworks:**

* **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2** – Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
* **ISO/IEC 27035** – Information Security Incident Management
* **SANS Incident Response Process** – Widely used practical approach

---

### **Key Metrics to Track:**

* MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)
* MTTR (Mean Time to Respond/Remediate)
* Number of incidents by type and severity
* Lessons implemented from past incidents

---

### **Conclusion:**

Incident response methodology is a **critical aspect of secure software operations**. A disciplined, repeatable approach ensures that security events are handled efficiently, systems are restored safely, and organizations continue to learn and evolve their defenses.
