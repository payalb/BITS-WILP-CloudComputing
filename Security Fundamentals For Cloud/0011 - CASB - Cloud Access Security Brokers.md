### **📌 Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)**  

**Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)** are **security solutions** that act as an intermediary between users and cloud services, providing **visibility, compliance enforcement, threat protection, and data security**. CASBs help organizations **secure cloud applications** such as **SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)** by enforcing security policies.  

---

## **1️⃣ Why CASB is Important?**  
With the rise of **cloud adoption**, organizations face security challenges such as:  

🔒 **Shadow IT** – Employees using unauthorized cloud applications without IT approval.  
🔒 **Data Loss & Leakage** – Sensitive data being stored or shared in unsecured cloud applications.  
🔒 **Insider Threats** – Malicious or negligent users exposing data to security risks.  
🔒 **Compliance Violations** – Failing to meet security standards like **GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST**.  
🔒 **Unauthorized Access** – Weak authentication mechanisms leading to **account takeovers**.  

CASBs help solve these issues by **monitoring cloud usage, enforcing security policies, and protecting sensitive data** in **real-time**.

## **2️⃣ Key Features of CASB**  

### **🔎 1. Visibility & Shadow IT Discovery**  
- Detects **unauthorized cloud applications** used within the organization.  
- Provides insights into **who is accessing what cloud services** and **from where**.  

### **📜 2. Compliance Enforcement**  
- Ensures adherence to **regulatory standards** like **GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2**.  
- Provides **audit logs** and compliance reports.  

### **🔐 3. Data Security & DLP (Data Loss Prevention)**  
- Prevents **sensitive data** (e.g., **PII, financial records, intellectual property**) from being shared outside the organization.  
- **Encrypts and classifies data** to prevent **accidental leaks**.  

### **⚠️ 4. Threat Protection**  
- Detects **malware, phishing attacks, and account takeovers** in cloud environments.  
- Uses **AI-driven behavioral analytics** to identify suspicious activities.  

### **🛑 5. Access Control & Risk Mitigation**  
- Enforces **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and **zero trust security policies**.  
- Restricts access based on **user location, device type, and risk level**.  

### **🔄 6. API Security & CASB Integration**  
- Monitors API traffic to **detect API abuses and data breaches**.  
- Integrates with **SIEM, IAM, DLP, and other security solutions**.
