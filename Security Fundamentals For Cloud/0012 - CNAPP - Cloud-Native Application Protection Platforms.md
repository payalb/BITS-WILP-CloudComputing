### **📌 Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP)**  

**Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs)** are **integrated security solutions** designed to protect **cloud-native applications** across their entire **development and runtime lifecycle**. CNAPPs combine multiple security functions like **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), Kubernetes Security, CI/CD Pipeline Security, and Runtime Threat Detection** into a single platform.  

---

## **1️⃣ Why is CNAPP Important?**  
Cloud-native applications are built using **microservices, containers, Kubernetes, and serverless architectures**. These introduce **new security challenges**, including:  

🔒 **Misconfigurations** – Incorrect cloud settings can lead to **data exposure**.  
🔒 **Container & Kubernetes Risks** – Vulnerabilities in **containerized workloads**.  
🔒 **Supply Chain Attacks** – **Malicious dependencies** in CI/CD pipelines.  
🔒 **Zero-Day Threats** – Cloud workloads targeted by **new cyber threats**.  
🔒 **Compliance Violations** – Failure to meet **GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST** standards.  

CNAPPs **solve these issues** by providing **end-to-end security** for **cloud-native environments**.

## **2️⃣ Key Features of CNAPP**  

### **🛠️ 1. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**  
- Detects and fixes **cloud misconfigurations** in **AWS, Azure, GCP**.  
- **Continuously monitors** cloud environments for **compliance violations**.  

### **⚔️ 2. Cloud Workload Protection (CWP)**  
- Secures **containers, VMs, Kubernetes, and serverless functions**.  
- Provides **runtime threat detection and automated response**.  

### **🛡️ 3. Kubernetes & Container Security**  
- Detects **misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and runtime threats** in Kubernetes clusters.  
- **Monitors container images** for known vulnerabilities before deployment.  

### **🔎 4. CI/CD Pipeline Security**  
- Scans **code repositories, container images, and build artifacts** for vulnerabilities.  
- Prevents **supply chain attacks** by securing **third-party dependencies**.  

### **📜 5. Compliance & Governance**  
- Automates compliance checks for **PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2**.  
- Generates **audit logs and compliance reports**.  

### **⚠️ 6. Identity & Access Security**  
- **Detects overprivileged IAM roles** to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Enforces **least privilege access** across cloud workloads.  

### **🚀 7. Runtime Threat Detection & Response**  
- Uses **AI-driven anomaly detection** to identify threats in **real time**.  
- Provides **automatic remediation** to stop attacks.

## **3️⃣ How CNAPP Works?**  

### **Step 1️⃣: Security in Development (Shift Left Security)**  
🔍 **Scans code, container images, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** for vulnerabilities **before deployment**.  

### **Step 2️⃣: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**  
🛠️ Continuously monitors cloud environments for **misconfigurations and compliance risks**.  

### **Step 3️⃣: Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) & Kubernetes Security**  
⚔️ **Secures containers, serverless functions, and Kubernetes clusters** during runtime.  

### **Step 4️⃣: Threat Detection & Response**  
🚀 Detects **runtime threats, insider attacks, and unauthorized access** in cloud environments.
