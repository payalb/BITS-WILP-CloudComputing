### **📌 Threat Modeling Manifesto**  

The **Threat Modeling Manifesto** is a set of principles and values designed to guide security professionals, developers, and organizations in implementing **effective threat modeling**. It was created in **2020** by a group of **security experts** to establish best practices for identifying and mitigating security threats **early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC)**.

## **1️⃣ Why is Threat Modeling Important?**  

🔍 **Proactively Identifies Security Risks** – Detect threats **before** they are exploited.  
💰 **Cost-Effective** – Fixing security flaws **early in development** is cheaper than post-deployment fixes.  
🛠️ **Improves Security Design** – Helps teams **understand attack surfaces and vulnerabilities**.  
📜 **Compliance & Risk Management** – Supports security frameworks like **ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, PCI DSS**.

## **2️⃣ Core Values of the Threat Modeling Manifesto**  

The manifesto defines **five core values** that prioritize **practical threat modeling**:  

### **1️⃣ A Culture of Finding and Fixing Design Issues Over Checkbox Compliance**  
✅ Focus on **actual security improvements**, not just compliance reports.  

### **2️⃣ People and Collaboration Over Processes and Tools**  
✅ Encourage **teamwork and knowledge-sharing** rather than relying solely on automated tools.  

### **3️⃣ Doing Threat Modeling Over Talking About It**  
✅ Emphasize **hands-on threat modeling** rather than just discussing theories.  

### **4️⃣ Continuous Refinement Over a Single Delivery**  
✅ **Threat modeling is an ongoing process** that must evolve with the system.  

### **5️⃣ Practical Threat Modeling Over Complete Threat Modeling**  
✅ **Start small and improve over time** instead of trying to model every possible threat upfront.

## **3️⃣ Key Principles of Threat Modeling**  

The manifesto also defines **four key principles** to guide effective threat modeling:  

### **🔍 1. Threat Modeling Must Be Aligned with Business Objectives**  
- Security should support **business goals**, not hinder them.  

### **🛠️ 2. Threat Modeling Produces a Useful Output**  
- The goal is to create **actionable security improvements**.  

### **📌 3. Threat Modeling Takes Input From a Variety of Perspectives**  
- **Developers, security teams, and business stakeholders** must collaborate.  

### **🔄 4. Threat Modeling Is a Continuous Process**  
- It must be **iterative** and **evolve** with the system.

## **4️⃣ How to Perform Threat Modeling?**  

Threat modeling follows a structured process:  

### **Step 1️⃣: Define the Scope**  
📌 Identify the **system components, data flows, and attack surfaces**.  

### **Step 2️⃣: Identify Threats**  
⚠️ Use frameworks like **STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)**.  

### **Step 3️⃣: Assess Risks**  
🔍 Evaluate the **likelihood and impact** of each threat.  

### **Step 4️⃣: Mitigate Threats**  
🛠️ Design **security controls, encryption, authentication, and access restrictions**.  

### **Step 5️⃣: Validate & Iterate**  
🔄 Regularly update the threat model as the system evolves.

## **5️⃣ Popular Threat Modeling Frameworks**  

🔹 **STRIDE** – Microsoft’s framework for categorizing threats.  
🔹 **DREAD** – Risk assessment model based on **Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability**.  
🔹 **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** – A risk-centric threat modeling framework.  
🔹 **LINDDUN** – Focuses on privacy threats.  
🔹 **OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)** – Organizational risk assessment.

## **6️⃣ Conclusion**  

The **Threat Modeling Manifesto** promotes **proactive security** by encouraging organizations to **find and fix design flaws** early. By focusing on **people, collaboration, and continuous improvement**, threat modeling helps **reduce security risks, improve system resilience, and ensure compliance**. 🚀
