### **🔍 Steps in Threat Modeling**  

Threat modeling follows a structured **five-step** approach to **identify, analyze, and mitigate** security threats in a system.  

---

## **1️⃣ Step 1: Define the System & Assets**  
**📌 Goal:** Understand **what needs protection** and **who interacts with the system**.  

🔹 Identify **assets** (e.g., databases, APIs, user data).  
🔹 Define **users** (legitimate users vs. attackers).  
🔹 Map **data flow** (how data moves between components).  
🔹 Understand **security boundaries** (authentication, authorization layers).  

**🛠 Example:**  
For an **e-commerce app**, assets include **user credentials, payment details, and order history**.  

---

## **2️⃣ Step 2: Identify Potential Threats**  
**📌 Goal:** Find **security risks** that could exploit the system.  

🔹 Use **threat modeling frameworks** like:  
   - **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).  
   - **DREAD** (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability).  
   - **MITRE ATT&CK** (Real-world attack tactics).  

**🛠 Example:**  
- **Tampering**: A hacker could modify payment details in a request.  
- **Information Disclosure**: Personal data might be exposed due to weak encryption.  

---

## **3️⃣ Step 3: Analyze & Prioritize Risks**  
**📌 Goal:** Evaluate the **likelihood** and **impact** of threats.  

🔹 Assess risks based on:  
   - **Likelihood** (How easy is the attack to execute?)  
   - **Impact** (What are the consequences?)  
   - **Exploitability** (How much effort is needed to fix it?)  

🔹 Prioritize threats:  
   - **High Risk**: Must be fixed immediately (e.g., unencrypted passwords).  
   - **Medium Risk**: Should be mitigated soon (e.g., missing rate limiting on API).  
   - **Low Risk**: Can be addressed later (e.g., minor UI security issues).  

**🛠 Example:**  
A **SQL Injection vulnerability** is **high risk** because it is **easy to exploit** and could lead to **data leaks**.  

---

## **4️⃣ Step 4: Implement Mitigation Strategies**  
**📌 Goal:** Apply **security controls** to reduce risks.  

🔹 Common security measures:  
   - **Authentication & Authorization** (MFA, Role-Based Access Control).  
   - **Data Protection** (Encryption, Secure Storage).  
   - **Input Validation** (Prevent SQL injection, XSS).  
   - **Network Security** (Firewalls, Zero Trust Architecture).  
   - **Logging & Monitoring** (Detect and respond to threats).  

**🛠 Example:**  
To prevent **API abuse**, enforce **rate limiting and authentication tokens**.  

---

## **5️⃣ Step 5: Validate & Iterate**  
**📌 Goal:** Continuously test and improve the security model.  

🔹 Perform **security testing**:  
   - **Penetration testing** to simulate attacks.  
   - **Code reviews** to find security flaws.  
   - **Automated security scans** for vulnerabilities.  

🔹 Update the **threat model regularly** as the system evolves.  

**🛠 Example:**  
If a new **feature** is added to an application (e.g., social login), update the **threat model** to check for **OAuth vulnerabilities**.

| **Step** | **Objective** | **Example** |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **1️⃣ Define System & Assets** | Identify assets, users, and data flows | Secure user credentials and payment data |
| **2️⃣ Identify Threats** | Use frameworks like STRIDE to find risks | Detect SQL Injection vulnerability |
| **3️⃣ Analyze & Prioritize Risks** | Assess risk based on likelihood & impact | Mark SQL Injection as High Risk |
| **4️⃣ Implement Mitigation** | Apply security controls | Use prepared statements for database queries |
| **5️⃣ Validate & Iterate** | Test, update, and improve security | Conduct regular penetration testing |
