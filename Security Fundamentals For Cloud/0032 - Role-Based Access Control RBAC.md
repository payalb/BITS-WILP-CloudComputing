### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  

RBAC is a security model that restricts system access based on **user roles** rather than individual permissions. It helps organizations manage access efficiently by assigning roles to users and granting permissions based on those roles.

### **Key Components of RBAC**  

#### **1. Roles**  
- A collection of permissions grouped based on job functions.  
- Example roles:  
  - **Admin** – Full system access  
  - **Editor** – Can modify content but not manage users  
  - **Viewer** – Read-only access  

#### **2. Permissions**  
- Define what actions a role can perform.  
- Example:  
  - **Read, Write, Delete** access to specific resources.  

#### **3. Users**  
- Individuals or groups assigned to specific roles.  
- A user can have multiple roles.  

#### **4. Resources**  
- The assets (files, databases, applications) users access based on their role.

### **RBAC Example**  

| **Role**   | **Permissions**           | **Example Users**  |  
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------|  
| Admin      | Read, Write, Delete, Manage Users | IT Admins        |  
| Editor     | Read, Write              | Content Creators   |  
| Viewer     | Read-Only                | General Employees  |

### **Benefits of RBAC**  
✅ **Improved Security** – Prevents unauthorized access.  
✅ **Simplified Access Management** – Easier to assign and revoke access.  
✅ **Compliance and Audit Readiness** – Helps meet regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).  
✅ **Minimized Risk of Privilege Escalation** – Users only get the permissions they need.

### **RBAC Best Practices**  
1. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** – Assign only necessary permissions.  
2. **Use a Role Hierarchy** – Organize roles from least to most privileged.  
3. **Regularly Review and Update Roles** – Ensure roles align with business needs.  
4. **Separate Duties** – Prevent conflicts of interest (e.g., a user approving and processing transactions).  
5. **Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) Access** – Provide temporary elevated access when needed.  

RBAC provides a structured approach to access control, improving security and efficiency in managing user permissions.
