**Data Classification Schemes**

---

Data classification schemes provide structured ways to categorize data based on its sensitivity, importance, and the type of protection it requires. These schemes help enforce appropriate security controls aligned with organizational policies and compliance standards.

---

**1. Based on Confidentiality**
This is the most common classification scheme and focuses on the risk posed by unauthorized disclosure.

* **Public**

  * Data that can be shared openly with the public.
  * Example: Press releases, marketing materials.

* **Internal**

  * Data meant for internal use only but not highly sensitive.
  * Example: Company policies, internal meeting notes.

* **Confidential**

  * Sensitive data that could cause harm if accessed by unauthorized users.
  * Example: Customer records, business plans, financial reports.

* **Restricted**

  * Highly sensitive information with the highest level of protection.
  * Example: Trade secrets, legal documents, cryptographic keys.

**2. Based on Integrity**
This scheme focuses on the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data.

* **High Integrity**

  * Data that must be highly accurate and trustworthy.
  * Example: Financial transactions, medical records, audit logs.

* **Medium Integrity**

  * Data that should be accurate but minor errors do not cause significant harm.
  * Example: Inventory records, employee schedules.

* **Low Integrity**

  * Data where inaccuracies have minimal impact.
  * Example: Informal notes, drafts of documents.

**3. Based on Availability**
This scheme addresses the need for data to be accessible when required.

* **High Availability**

  * Data required for real-time or near-real-time access.
  * Example: E-commerce databases, operational dashboards.

* **Medium Availability**

  * Data needed regularly but not continuously.
  * Example: HR files, monthly reports.

* **Low Availability**

  * Data that can tolerate delays in access.
  * Example: Archived documents, historical records.

**Conclusion**
Using multiple classification schemes based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability allows organizations to apply tailored security controls. This ensures that data is protected appropriately according to its value, sensitivity, and usage requirements.
