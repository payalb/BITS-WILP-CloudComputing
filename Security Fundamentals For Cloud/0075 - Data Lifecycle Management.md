**Data Lifecycle Management (DLM)**

---

**Definition**
Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) is the process of managing data from its initial creation or acquisition through various stagesâ€”storage, usage, archival, and ultimately secure deletion. DLM ensures that data is governed effectively across all phases of its existence.

**Stages of the Data Lifecycle**

1. **Creation/Collection**

   * Data is generated, collected, or received.
   * Example: User sign-ups, IoT sensors, financial transactions.

2. **Storage**

   * Data is saved in databases, file systems, or cloud repositories.
   * It must be stored securely, with appropriate encryption and access controls.

3. **Usage**

   * Data is accessed, processed, and analyzed for business operations.
   * Usage should follow access control and auditing policies.

4. **Sharing/Distribution**

   * Data may be shared internally or externally.
   * Requires proper authorization, logging, and sometimes anonymization or masking.

5. **Archival**

   * Older data that is no longer actively used but must be retained for legal or historical reasons is archived.
   * Archived data should remain protected and retrievable when needed.

6. **Destruction**

   * Data that is no longer needed is securely deleted or destroyed to prevent unauthorized recovery.
   * Methods include cryptographic erasure or physical media destruction.

**Importance of DLM**

* **Protected**

  * Ensures data is encrypted, backed up, and access is controlled at every stage.
  * Reduces exposure to breaches or leaks.

* **Compliant**

  * Helps meet legal and regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.
  * Ensures data is retained or deleted according to policies.

* **Accessible**

  * Ensures authorized users can access the data they need, when they need it.
  * Enhances business agility and operational efficiency.

**Risks of Poor Lifecycle Management**

* Data breaches due to unsecured archives or forgotten storage.
* Regulatory fines from non-compliance (e.g., retaining data beyond legal limits).
* Loss of trust from mishandled or exposed sensitive data.
* Increased storage costs from unmanaged data accumulation.

**Conclusion**
Data Lifecycle Management is critical to cloud data security and governance. It ensures that data remains secure, compliant, and useful throughout its existence, reducing risks and enhancing operational control.
