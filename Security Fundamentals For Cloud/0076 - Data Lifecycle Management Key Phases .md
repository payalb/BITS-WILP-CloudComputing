**Data Lifecycle Management – Key Phases**

---

**1. Data Creation**

* This is the initial phase where data is generated or collected.
* Sources include user inputs, system logs, sensors, applications, or third-party services.
* **Security Considerations:**

  * Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks or data corruption.
  * Ensure secure collection methods (e.g., HTTPS, authenticated APIs).

---

**2. Data Storage**

* Data is saved in databases, object storage, or file systems, either on-premises or in the cloud.
* **Security Measures:**

  * Use encryption at rest to protect sensitive information.
  * Apply strict access controls using identity and role-based permissions.
  * Define and enforce data retention policies to avoid storing data longer than necessary.

---

**3. Data Use**

* In this phase, data is processed, analyzed, or accessed for business activities.
* **Protection Techniques:**

  * Use data masking or anonymization to protect PII during processing or analysis.
  * Ensure secure data sharing (e.g., using encrypted channels, access tokens).
  * Monitor usage with auditing and logging for compliance and anomaly detection.

---

**4. Data Archival**

* Data that is no longer actively used but must be retained for compliance, legal, or historical purposes is moved to long-term storage.
* **Archival Best Practices:**

  * Store data in low-cost, secure storage services.
  * Maintain accessibility when needed (e.g., for audits or investigations).
  * Ensure continued protection with encryption and access control.

---

**5. Data Destruction**

* When data is no longer required, it must be securely deleted to prevent misuse.
* **Secure Destruction Methods:**

  * Use cryptographic erasure, data wiping, or physical destruction (for hardware).
  * Ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR’s “right to be forgotten”).
  * Maintain logs and certificates of destruction for auditing purposes.

| Phase       | Key Actions                                               | Security Focus                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Creation    | Input validation, secure collection                       | Prevent data corruption/injection             |
| Storage     | Encrypt at rest, enforce access control, retention policy | Data confidentiality and compliance           |
| Use         | Masking, anonymization, secure sharing                    | Protect data in use and during transmission   |
| Archival    | Secure low-cost storage, maintain accessibility           | Long-term security and compliance             |
| Destruction | Irreversible deletion methods, compliance logging         | Prevent unauthorized recovery, ensure privacy |

Proper management of each phase is essential to maintaining data security, ensuring regulatory compliance, and reducing risk in cloud environments.
