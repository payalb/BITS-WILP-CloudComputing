**Why Encrypt in the Cloud?**
Encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data in cloud environments. As cloud adoption increases, so do the risks of data breaches, unauthorized access, and regulatory violations. Encryption ensures that data remains secure and unreadable to anyone without the proper decryption keys, even in shared or multi-tenant infrastructures.

---

**1. Confidentiality**

* Encryption ensures that only authorized users or systems can access the original data.
* If an attacker gains access to encrypted data, it remains unintelligible without the correct key.
* This is critical for protecting sensitive assets such as personal information, financial records, and intellectual property.

---

**2. Integrity**

* Encryption helps detect unauthorized changes to data.
* Cryptographic algorithms can include integrity checks, such as hashes or digital signatures, that reveal if data has been altered.
* This ensures that stored or transmitted data remains in its intended and trusted state.

**3. Compliance**

* Many regulations mandate encryption as a core part of data protection strategies.
* Examples include:

  * **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation): Requires organizations to protect EU citizens’ personal data.
  * **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Requires encryption for protected health information (PHI).
  * **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Enforces encryption of cardholder data.
* Using strong encryption helps meet compliance requirements and reduces legal and financial risks.

**Conclusion**
Encryption is not just a security enhancement—it is a foundational requirement for protecting cloud data. It ensures that data remains confidential, unaltered, and compliant with regulatory expectations, forming a strong defense against modern cyber threats.
