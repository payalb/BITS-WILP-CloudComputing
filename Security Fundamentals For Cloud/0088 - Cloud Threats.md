**Cloud Threats** refer to security risks and vulnerabilities that target cloud computing environments, such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. These threats can affect data confidentiality, integrity, availability, and service functionality.

### **Common Cloud Threats**

1. **Data Breaches**

   * Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
   * Often caused by poor access controls or misconfigured storage (e.g., exposed S3 buckets).

2. **Insecure APIs**

   * Cloud services are accessed using APIs.
   * Poorly secured APIs can be exploited for unauthorized access, DoS attacks, or data theft.

3. **Account Hijacking**

   * Attackers steal cloud credentials through phishing, social engineering, or malware.
   * Can result in complete control over cloud services.

4. **Misconfiguration**

   * Most common threat.
   * Example: A database left publicly accessible or lack of encryption.
   * Often due to human error or lack of cloud security knowledge.

5. **Insider Threats**

   * Malicious or careless employees misusing access to data or resources.
   * Especially dangerous due to already having legitimate access.

6. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**

   * Overwhelming cloud services with traffic to make them unavailable to legitimate users.

7. **Malware Injection**

   * Attacker injects malicious code into a cloud service (e.g., SaaS).
   * The code executes when users interact with the service.

8. **Insufficient Identity & Access Management**

   * Weak passwords, lack of MFA, and excessive permissions increase attack risk.

9. **Data Loss**

   * Caused by accidental deletion, overwriting, or ransomware.
   * Lack of proper backup and disaster recovery policies worsens the impact.

10. **Shared Technology Vulnerabilities**

* Multi-tenant environments may share resources.
* Vulnerabilities in hypervisors, containers, or shared libraries can lead to cross-tenant attacks.

### **Defense Strategies**

* **Use strong IAM policies:** Enforce least privilege, MFA, and role-based access.
* **Regular audits & monitoring:** Track user behavior and configuration changes.
* **Secure APIs:** Validate inputs, use authentication and encryption.
* **Encrypt data:** In transit and at rest.
* **Apply security patches:** Regularly update cloud software and services.
* **Incident response plans:** Prepare for breaches or data loss.
* **Cloud-native security tools:** Use AWS GuardDuty, Azure Security Center, etc.
