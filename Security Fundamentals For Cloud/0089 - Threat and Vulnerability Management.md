**Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM)** is a crucial component of cybersecurity that focuses on identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities within an organization's systems, networks, and applications.

### **Key Concepts**

| **Term**          | **Definition**                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Threat**        | A potential cause of an unwanted incident that may harm a system or organization (e.g., malware, hackers).                       |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat to gain unauthorized access or cause damage (e.g., unpatched software). |
| **Risk**          | The potential impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability (Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact).                            |

### **TVM Process Steps**

1. **Asset Discovery**

   * Identify all assets (servers, databases, applications, etc.).
   * Build an inventory for scanning and monitoring.

2. **Threat Intelligence Gathering**

   * Use threat feeds, logs, and reports to understand active and emerging threats.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning**

   * Use automated tools (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) to detect known vulnerabilities in systems.

4. **Risk Assessment**

   * Evaluate vulnerabilities based on:

     * CVSS score (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
     * Business impact
     * Exploitability

5. **Prioritization**

   * Rank threats/vulnerabilities by severity and impact on business operations.

6. **Remediation & Mitigation**

   * Apply patches, reconfigure systems, or isolate affected assets.
   * Use compensating controls if a direct fix isn't possible.

7. **Monitoring & Re-Assessment**

   * Continuously monitor for new threats.
   * Re-scan and re-assess regularly to ensure ongoing protection.

### **Best Practices**

* Implement **patch management** policies.
* Use **automated scanners** and integrate them into CI/CD pipelines.
* Maintain **asset inventory** and regularly update it.
* Enforce **least privilege access control**.
* Conduct **penetration testing** to simulate real-world attacks.
* Educate employees about **social engineering and phishing**.
