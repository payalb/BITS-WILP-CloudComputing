### **Vulnerability Scanning** â€“ Explained

**Vulnerability scanning** is an automated process of identifying security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. It helps detect known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, outdated software, and potential entry points that attackers could exploit.

### **Why Vulnerability Scanning Is Important**

* Detects **known vulnerabilities** (e.g., CVEs)
* Helps maintain **regulatory compliance** (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
* Identifies **misconfigurations** and **weak settings**
* Reduces **attack surface**
* Enables **proactive security management**

### **How Vulnerability Scanning Works**

1. **Asset Discovery**

   * Identify all devices, applications, and systems in the environment.
2. **Target Selection**

   * Choose what to scan: IP addresses, web apps, servers, containers, etc.
3. **Scan Execution**

   * The scanner probes systems using known vulnerability signatures.
   * Compares results with databases like the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**.
4. **Analysis & Reporting**

   * Results are scored (usually with CVSS) and prioritized.
   * Includes remediation recommendations.
5. **Remediation**

   * Apply patches, update software, or change configurations.
6. **Rescan**

   * Verify that vulnerabilities have been fixed.

### **Types of Vulnerability Scanning**

| **Type**                     | **Description**                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network-based Scanning**   | Identifies vulnerabilities in network devices like routers, firewalls, and switches.          |
| **Host-based Scanning**      | Scans individual systems for OS-level vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.                  |
| **Web Application Scanning** | Detects flaws like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF in websites and web apps.                         |
| **Database Scanning**        | Focuses on DBs like MySQL, Oracle for misconfigs, weak passwords, and missing patches.        |
| **Cloud Scanning**           | Evaluates cloud assets (AWS, Azure, GCP) for exposed services, IAM flaws, and storage issues. |

### **Best Practices for Vulnerability Scanning**

* **Scan regularly** (e.g., weekly or monthly).
* **Automate scanning** as part of DevOps/CI-CD pipelines.
* **Use credentialed scans** for deeper visibility.
* **Validate with penetration testing**.
* **Track and fix** vulnerabilities based on priority.
* **Keep your scanning tools updated** with the latest signatures and CVEs.
