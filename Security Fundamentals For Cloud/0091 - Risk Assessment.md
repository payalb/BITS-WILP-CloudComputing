### ‚öñÔ∏è **Risk Assessment** ‚Äì Explained

**Risk Assessment** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks to determine their potential impact on an organization‚Äôs systems, operations, data, and business goals.

---

### üîç **Why Risk Assessment Is Important**

* Helps **prioritize security efforts** based on actual risk
* Prevents **wasted resources** on low-impact issues
* Supports **regulatory compliance** (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, HIPAA)
* Enables better **business decision-making**
* Strengthens overall **cybersecurity posture**

### üîÑ **Risk Assessment Process**

1. **Identify Assets**

   * List critical assets like servers, databases, networks, applications, and sensitive data.

2. **Identify Threats**

   * Examples: malware, insider attacks, natural disasters, phishing, DoS, supply chain compromise.

3. **Identify Vulnerabilities**

   * Weak passwords, unpatched software, open ports, misconfigurations.

4. **Determine Likelihood**

   * Estimate how likely it is that a threat could exploit a vulnerability.

5. **Determine Impact**

   * Assess the potential damage (financial, operational, reputational, legal).

6. **Calculate Risk**

   * Basic formula:

     $$
     \text{Risk} = \text{Threat} \times \text{Vulnerability} \times \text{Impact}
     $$
   * Often scored qualitatively (Low, Medium, High) or numerically (e.g., 1‚Äì10).

7. **Prioritize Risks**

   * Focus on high-risk vulnerabilities that have a high likelihood and impact.

8. **Recommend Controls**

   * Implement security controls: patches, firewalls, training, backups, encryption, etc.

9. **Document & Report**

   * Record findings and share them with stakeholders or management.

10. **Review & Reassess**

* Risk is **dynamic**, so assessments must be updated periodically or after major changes.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Best Practices**

* Involve both **IT and business stakeholders**.
* Focus on **data-driven** assessments.
* Align with business goals and **regulatory requirements**.
* Include **emerging threats** like zero-days and cloud-specific risks.
* Combine **automated tools** with **manual reviews** for accuracy.
