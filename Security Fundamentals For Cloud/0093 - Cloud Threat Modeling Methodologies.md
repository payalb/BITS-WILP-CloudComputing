Here's a **detailed explanation** of **Cloud Threat Modeling Methodologies** ‚Äì focusing on **STRIDE**, **PASTA**, and **DREAD** ‚Äì with examples and cloud-specific applications:

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **1. STRIDE (Microsoft)**

**Purpose**: To **categorize and identify threats** in system components based on six common security concerns.

| **STRIDE** Element             | **Description**                  | **Cloud Example**                                 |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **S ‚Äì Spoofing**               | Impersonating users or systems   | Using stolen IAM credentials to access AWS        |
| **T ‚Äì Tampering**              | Altering data or code            | Modifying a cloud VM image in a shared registry   |
| **R ‚Äì Repudiation**            | Denying actions without evidence | Lack of audit logs for S3 access in AWS           |
| **I ‚Äì Information Disclosure** | Leaking sensitive info           | Public GCS bucket exposing customer data          |
| **D ‚Äì Denial of Service**      | Making service unavailable       | Flooding Azure API Gateway with traffic           |
| **E ‚Äì Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorized permissions | Exploiting misconfigured IAM role to become admin |

### üîß STRIDE Process:

* **Step 1**: Diagram your cloud architecture (e.g., data flows between services)
* **Step 2**: Identify each component and trust boundary
* **Step 3**: Apply STRIDE to each component and interaction
* **Step 4**: Document threats and add mitigations (e.g., encryption, IAM policies)

> ‚úÖ **Best for**: Developers and architects needing a structured, easy-to-apply threat model.

## üß† **2. PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**

**Purpose**: Aligns **technical risks with business impact** using a detailed, staged methodology.

### üîÅ **PASTA 7 Stages**:

| **Stage**                        | **Description**                           | **Cloud Perspective**                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Define Objectives**         | Business goals and risk appetite          | Protect customer data stored in AWS S3        |
| 2. **Define Technical Scope**    | Identify systems, APIs, users             | List all AWS services and user roles          |
| 3. **Application Decomposition** | Understand architecture and data flows    | Cloud architecture diagrams (VPCs, ECS, etc.) |
| 4. **Threat Analysis**           | Identify threat actors and attack vectors | External hackers, malicious insiders, APTs    |
| 5. **Vulnerability Analysis**    | Identify flaws and misconfigs             | Unpatched EC2 instances, exposed APIs         |
| 6. **Attack Simulation**         | Model attacker behavior and success rate  | Red teaming, penetration testing in cloud     |
| 7. **Risk/Impact Analysis**      | Estimate business damage and prioritize   | Financial loss from data breach in Azure Blob |

> ‚úÖ **Best for**: Enterprise environments or cloud-native apps needing alignment with **business objectives** and **compliance**.

## üìä **3. DREAD (Deprecated by Microsoft but still useful for risk scoring)**

**Purpose**: Quantifies **risk severity** based on 5 factors. Each threat is scored from 0‚Äì10, and the average is used for prioritization.

| **DREAD Element**        | **Question**                     | **Cloud Example**                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **D ‚Äì Damage Potential** | How bad is the impact?           | Complete loss of customer records in RDS        |
| **R ‚Äì Reproducibility**  | How easily can it be repeated?   | Easily automatable API exploit                  |
| **E ‚Äì Exploitability**   | How easy is it to attack?        | Open public endpoint with weak auth             |
| **A ‚Äì Affected Users**   | How many users are impacted?     | 10,000 customers lose access to app             |
| **D ‚Äì Discoverability**  | How easy is it to find the flaw? | Known CVE with public exploit for cloud storage |

### üìà Example DREAD Scoring:

| Metric            | Score (0‚Äì10)                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Damage            | 9                           |
| Reproducibility   | 8                           |
| Exploitability    | 7                           |
| Affected Users    | 10                          |
| Discoverability   | 6                           |
| **Average Score** | **8.0**     ‚Üí **High Risk** |

> ‚úÖ **Best for**: Prioritizing cloud threats and comparing which ones to mitigate first.
