### Cloud Penetration Testing & Red Teaming

**Cloud Penetration Testing** and **Red Teaming** are advanced security assessment techniques used to **test the security of cloud environments** by simulating real-world attacks.

## What is Cloud Penetration Testing?

**Cloud Penetration Testing (Cloud Pentest)** is an **authorized simulated attack** on a cloud system to evaluate its security. The goal is to **find vulnerabilities** in cloud infrastructure, applications, services, and configurations **before attackers do**.

### Key Objectives:

* Test cloud configurations (e.g., S3 bucket permissions, IAM policies)
* Check for insecure APIs, misconfigured services
* Identify weak authentication or authorization
* Discover exposed data, services, or credentials

### Cloud Pentesting Scope Areas

| Component                   | Examples of Tests                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage Services**        | Public S3 buckets, Azure Blob access, GCS misconfigs |
| **Identity & Access Mgmt**  | Overprivileged IAM roles, leaked keys, MFA bypass    |
| **Networking**              | Open ports, exposed VMs, insecure security groups    |
| **Serverless Functions**    | AWS Lambda injection, Azure Function misconfig       |
| **Containers & Kubernetes** | Insecure K8s dashboard, container breakout           |
| **APIs**                    | Broken auth, rate-limiting issues, injection flaws   |

### Cloud Provider Guidelines for Pentesting

Before testing, cloud providers require **pre-approval** or have **acceptable use policies**:

| Provider  | Penetration Testing Policy                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS**   | No pre-approval needed for most tests; [AWS policy link](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/)               |
| **Azure** | No prior approval needed, but follow [Microsoftâ€™s Acceptable Use Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/termsofuse) |
| **GCP**   | No approval required; see [Google's policy](https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup)                                              |

## What is Red Teaming in the Cloud?

**Red Teaming** is a full-scope, stealthy simulation of a **real-world attack** across people, processes, and technology. It includes **social engineering**, **physical access attempts**, and **cloud compromise tactics**.

### Key Goals:

* Test **detection and response** capabilities (not just vulnerabilities)
* Simulate **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**
* Assess **blue team (defender)** effectiveness

### Red Teaming Workflow in Cloud Environments

| Phase                    | Description                        | Cloud Example                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Reconnaissance**       | Collect metadata, exposed services | Find open S3 buckets, GitHub tokens           |
| **Initial Access**       | Gain a foothold                    | Phishing for IAM credentials                  |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Elevate access level               | Misconfigured IAM allows privilege escalation |
| **Lateral Movement**     | Explore internal systems           | Move between VPCs or Azure subscriptions      |
| **Persistence**          | Maintain access                    | Create new IAM user with admin rights         |
| **Exfiltration**         | Steal data                         | Download sensitive data from storage          |
| **Evade Detection**      | Avoid logs, alerts                 | Disable CloudTrail or use proxy chains        |

## Best Practices for Cloud Testing Teams

* Use **least privilege** principles when testing IAM
* Isolate **test environments** to avoid production risks
* Enable **detailed logging** (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor)
* Ensure **permission and compliance approval**
* Integrate results into **threat modeling** and **patching pipelines**
