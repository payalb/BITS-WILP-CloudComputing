Here is an expanded overview of the **Types of Cloud Forensics**, categorized based on service models, deployment models, and investigative perspectives:

## **Types of Cloud Forensics**

Cloud forensics can be classified in various ways depending on what layer or environment the investigation targets. Below are the major types:

---

### 1. **Based on Cloud Service Models**

These refer to the type of cloud service—Infrastructure, Platform, or Software—and affect the scope and control available for forensic analysis.

#### **a. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Forensics**

* **Scope**: VMs, virtual networks, storage systems.
* **Investigation Focus**: Disk images, system logs, access controls, traffic flow logs.
* **Example**: Analyzing a compromised virtual machine on AWS EC2 or Azure VM.
* **Control**: High control and visibility; customers manage the OS and applications.

#### **b. Platform as a Service (PaaS) Forensics**

* **Scope**: Applications running on managed platforms (e.g., databases, web apps).
* **Investigation Focus**: Application logs, API calls, identity and access records.
* **Example**: Investigating unauthorized data access in a managed Azure SQL Database.
* **Control**: Limited control; logs and telemetry are often provided by the cloud provider.

#### **c. Software as a Service (SaaS) Forensics**

* **Scope**: Third-party applications (e.g., Microsoft 365, Salesforce).
* **Investigation Focus**: User activity logs, file access histories, data export records.
* **Example**: Tracing data exfiltration via a user’s OneDrive in Microsoft 365.
* **Control**: Very limited; investigations depend heavily on logs and tools offered by the SaaS provider.

### 2. **Based on Cloud Deployment Models**

These models influence data accessibility and jurisdiction.

#### **a. Public Cloud Forensics**

* **Environment**: Shared infrastructure across multiple tenants.
* **Challenges**: Data isolation, access limitations, provider cooperation.
* **Use Case**: Forensic analysis of a compromised public-facing web server hosted in AWS.

#### **b. Private Cloud Forensics**

* **Environment**: Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.
* **Benefits**: Greater control over data, more comprehensive logging.
* **Use Case**: Investigating a data breach within an on-premises OpenStack cloud.

#### **c. Hybrid Cloud Forensics**

* **Environment**: Integration of on-premises and cloud resources.
* **Focus**: Coordinating investigations across environments; correlating logs.
* **Use Case**: Tracing an attack that started in the internal network and moved to the cloud.

#### **d. Multi-Cloud Forensics**

* **Environment**: Use of multiple public cloud providers (e.g., AWS + Azure).
* **Challenge**: Consistent logging, unified monitoring, varying toolsets.
* **Use Case**: Incident impacting systems spread across AWS and Google Cloud.

### 3. **Based on Forensic Data Sources**

These define the technical layers being examined.

#### **a. Network Forensics in the Cloud**

* **Focus**: Packet captures, flow logs (e.g., VPC Flow Logs, NSG Flow Logs).
* **Use Case**: Detecting lateral movement or C2 communication.

#### **b. Host/System Forensics**

* **Focus**: Virtual machine snapshots, disk images, memory dumps.
* **Use Case**: Malware analysis on a compromised cloud-hosted system.

#### **c. Application Forensics**

* **Focus**: Application logs, API usage, session data.
* **Use Case**: Investigating unauthorized access through web app vulnerabilities.

#### **d. Storage Forensics**

* **Focus**: File metadata, access history, deleted data recovery.
* **Use Case**: Recovering and analyzing files from a cloud object storage bucket (e.g., S3, Azure Blob).

#### **e. Identity and Access Forensics**

* **Focus**: IAM logs, multifactor authentication data, privilege escalation paths.
* **Use Case**: Tracing an insider threat using elevated permissions.

---

### 4. **Based on Investigation Perspective**

#### **a. Reactive Forensics**

* Performed after an incident has occurred.
* **Goal**: Understand what happened, who did it, and how to prevent recurrence.

#### **b. Proactive Forensics**

* Ongoing monitoring and collection of forensic data even before incidents occur.
* **Goal**: Build forensic readiness and support early detection.

### Conclusion

Cloud forensics spans a broad range of techniques, tools, and environments. The type of forensic investigation required depends heavily on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment model (public, private, hybrid), and data sources (network, system, identity). Understanding these types ensures a more effective, targeted, and legally sound investigation strategy.
