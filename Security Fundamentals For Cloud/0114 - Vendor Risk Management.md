## **Vendor Risk Management (VRM)**

**Vendor Risk Management** is the process of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating risks associated with third-party vendors and service providers. In cloud computing and modern IT environments, where businesses rely heavily on external providers for infrastructure, applications, and services, **managing vendor-related risks is critical to maintaining security, compliance, and business continuity**.

### **Why Vendor Risk Management Is Important**

* **Dependence on third parties** increases the attack surface.
* **Vendors can introduce risks** through data breaches, poor security practices, non-compliance, or service outages.
* Regulatory frameworks (like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001) **require due diligence** in vendor selection and monitoring.
* **Cloud providers** (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) operate under a shared responsibility model, making clear boundaries and accountability essential.

### **Key Components of Vendor Risk Management**

1. **Vendor Identification and Inventory**

   * Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all third-party vendors.
   * Classify vendors based on risk levels (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).

2. **Risk Assessment**

   * Evaluate each vendor's security posture and compliance with standards.
   * Use **questionnaires**, **security assessments**, and **audit reports** (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).
   * Assess risks across multiple domains:

     * Data access and sensitivity
     * Regulatory compliance
     * Financial stability
     * Operational resilience

3. **Due Diligence and Onboarding**

   * Conduct thorough due diligence before entering into a contract.
   * Ensure vendors meet **minimum security requirements** and support contractual clauses like:

     * Data protection agreements (DPAs)
     * Right to audit
     * Incident notification timelines

4. **Risk Mitigation**

   * Define controls and obligations for vendors, such as:

     * Encryption of data in transit and at rest
     * Limiting access through RBAC and least privilege
     * Secure APIs and integration methods
     * Clear SLAs for availability and response time

5. **Monitoring and Review**

   * Continuously monitor vendor performance and security posture.
   * Use tools to track changes, access logs, and reported incidents.
   * Schedule regular reviews and reassessments based on vendor criticality.

6. **Incident Management**

   * Define escalation paths and roles in the event of a vendor-related incident.
   * Require vendors to report breaches within agreed timeframes.
   * Coordinate incident response with the vendor where needed.

7. **Termination and Offboarding**

   * Have clear policies for vendor exit:

     * Data return or destruction
     * Access revocation
     * Continuity of service plans
