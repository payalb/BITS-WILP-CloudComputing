**Cloud contracts** are legally binding agreements between a cloud service provider and a customer that define the terms, responsibilities, and expectations related to the delivery and use of cloud services. These agreements are essential to **manage risk, ensure compliance, and clarify legal and operational responsibilities** in a cloud environment.

### **4. Best Practices for Reviewing Cloud Contracts**

1. **Involve Legal and Compliance Teams Early**
   Ensure regulatory and legal risks are assessed before signing.

2. **Review SLAs Carefully**
   Make sure performance standards and remedies for failures are clearly defined.

3. **Ensure Data Portability and Exit Terms Are Clear**
   Verify you can retrieve your data in a usable format upon exit.

4. **Confirm Security Responsibilities**
   Understand the shared responsibility model—what’s the provider’s duty vs. yours.

5. **Request Regular Security and Compliance Reports**
   Include clauses requiring the provider to supply certifications and audit results.

6. **Negotiate Where Possible**
   For enterprise-level services, negotiate more favorable terms around data handling, liability, and uptime.
