The **Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)** is a key tool developed by the **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)** to support organizations in **assessing the security capabilities of cloud service providers**. It is tightly aligned with the **Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)** and provides a structured way to evaluate how well a provider implements cloud security controls.

---

## **What Is CAIQ?**

The **CAIQ** is a **standardized questionnaire** that cloud providers fill out to **demonstrate transparency** in their security and compliance practices. Each question maps directly to specific controls in the **Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)**.

* It is intended to be **shared with customers**.
* It provides detailed information on **how a provider addresses each security control domain**.
* Helps organizations **conduct due diligence** when selecting or reviewing cloud vendors.

## **Purpose and Importance**

| **Purpose**                       | **Benefit**                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standardizes security assessments | Enables consistent evaluations of cloud providers                       |
| Increases transparency            | Helps providers communicate their security posture to customers         |
| Speeds up procurement processes   | Reduces the time needed for security review and vendor risk assessments |
| Facilitates compliance audits     | Aligns responses with regulatory and industry security requirements     |

## **Structure of the CAIQ**

The CAIQ consists of **hundreds of questions** (over 200 in recent versions), categorized under the **17 domains** of the **Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM v4.0)**, such as:

* **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**
* **TVM (Threat and Vulnerability Management)**
* **DSI (Data Security and Information Lifecycle Management)**
* **SEF (Security Incident Management)**
* **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)**

Each question typically has the following format:

* **Control ID:** (e.g., IAM-12)
* **Control Name:** (e.g., User Access Review)
* **Question:** (e.g., *Does the CSP perform regular user access reviews for critical systems?*)
* **Provider Response:** (Yes/No/Other)
* **Implementation Description:** (Free-text explanation of how the control is implemented)

## **Who Uses CAIQ?**

### **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs):**

* Complete the CAIQ to **demonstrate their security posture** to customers and auditors.
* Can publish their responses in the **CSA STAR Registry** (Security, Trust, Assurance, and Risk).

### **Customers and Auditors:**

* Use the CAIQ to **assess third-party risk** during vendor selection or compliance reviews.
* Helps verify whether the cloud provider meets internal or regulatory requirements.

## **CAIQ vs. CCM**

| **Feature** | **CCM**                                     | **CAIQ**                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Security control framework                  | Assessment questionnaire aligned to CCM               |
| Format      | Matrix with control domains and control IDs | Spreadsheet with questions linked to each CCM control |
| Audience    | Security teams and cloud architects         | Cloud providers and security assessors                |
| Primary Use | Establishing a control baseline             | Evaluating implementation of controls by a provider   |

---

## **Benefits of Using CAIQ**

* **Due Diligence:** Provides a clear view of how cloud providers implement security controls.
* **Risk Management:** Helps organizations understand and mitigate third-party risks.
* **Compliance Support:** Aids in meeting legal and regulatory obligations during audits.
* **Benchmarking:** Allows comparison of multiple cloud vendors using the same criteria.

## **How to Access the CAIQ**

You can download the latest **CAIQ template** from the [Cloud Security Alliance website](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/caiq). It is usually available in Excel or Google Sheets format.

Additionally, many providers publish completed CAIQs publicly in the **[CSA STAR Registry](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/registry/)**.
