### Supply Chain & Manufacturing: ITAR and DFARS (USA)

* **ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations)** controls the export of defense-related technology.

* **DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement)** mandates cybersecurity requirements for defense contractors.

* Key Cloud Requirements:

  * Use FedRAMP High or DoD IL4+ certified providers
  * Implement Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) protections
  * Submit incident reports per contract obligations

### Education: FERPA (USA)

**Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)** protects the privacy of student education records.
